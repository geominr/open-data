Lheidli T'enneh will have law-making authority over these lands. Lheidli T'enneh will have no governance authority over the remaining 55 hectares of land that will transfer to Lheidli T'enneh as private fee-simple land.

Many of the parcels of land are currently registered in the provincial land registration system and this registration will continue. In addition, the Final Agreement identifies other parcels that will be registered in this system.

CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements,California Department of Fish and Wildlife | cdfwgis,"The CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements dataset is a subset of the CDFW Lands dataset. It contains lands owned (fee title), some operated (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies that may be publicly accessible) and conservation easements held by CDFW. CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements replaces the prior dataset, DFG Owned and Operated Lands, which included only fee title lands and some operated lands (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies and that may be publicly accessible). This is a generalized version dataset that has a shorter attribute table than the original and also has been dissolved based on the fields included. Please note that some lands may not be accessible due to the protection of resources and habitat. It is recommended that users contact the appropriate regional office for access information and consult regulations for CDFW lands in Sections 550, 550.1, 551, 552, 630 and 702. The CDFW Lands dataset is a digitized geographical inventory of selected lands owned and/or administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Properties such as ecological reserves, wildlife areas, undesignated lands containing biological resource values, public and fishing access lands, and CDFW fish hatcheries are among those lands included in this inventory. Types of properties owned or administered by CDFW which may not be included in this dataset are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as fishing piers, fish spawning grounds, fish barriers, and other minor parcels. Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps relating to that parcel. The approximate parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S. Geological Survey 7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and attributed before being added to the dataset. In some cases, assessor parcel or best available datasets are used to digitize the boundary. Using parcel data to adjust the boundaries is a work in progress and will be incorporated in the future. Township, range, and section lines were based on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' series topographic maps (1:24,000 - scale). In some areas, the boundaries will not align with the Bureau of Land Management's Public Lands Survey System (PLSS).

Roadways are divided into the following three classification categories:Arterials: These roadways provide the highest level of mobility at the greatest vehicular speed for the longest uninterrupted distances and are not intended to provide access to specific locations. Arterials are further subdivided into Principal Arterials and Minor Arterials. However, for the purposes of this report they have been grouped together. Please note that Interstates are considered Arterials, but they have been given their own category in this report.Collectors: These roadways provide some level of both mobility and access. They collect traffic from Local roads and funnel it to Arterials. In rural areas, collectors are further subdivided into Major Collectors and Minor Collectors, but for the purposes of this report they have been grouped together.Locals: These roadways provide access to abutting land with little or no emphasis on mobility.

Administrative Large Parcels Py,Alaska Department of Natural Resources ArcGIS Online | irm_admin,"This data contains the administrative large parcel boundaries for both the state and federal government. It combines the formerly known Legislatively Designated Areas (LDA's), or state parcels, and the Conservation System Units (CSU's), or federal parcels, with data improvements. The CSU's also contained additional federal management units, such as National Forests; hence, the name change. Data improvements are significant compared to previous versions of the LDA's and CSU's. The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) was used for all of the state parcels and several of the federal parcels. The previous LDA's coverage (prior to 2000), was automated at a section level. This dataset delineates the boundaries based on the exact legal description. Special notes about LDA's - The legislature may designate an area for special uses. Areas designated by the legislature may include refuges, sanctuaries, critical habitat areas, ranges, special management areas, forests, parks, recreation areas, preserves, public use areas, recreation rivers, and recreational mining areas. Consult the referenced Alaska Statutes to determine the legal description and special management intent of any particular area. Many areas also have regulations and plans that govern uses within their boundaries. State Wildlife Areas - Includes Sanctuaries, State Range Areas, Critical Habitat Areas and Refuges. They are established under Title 16, Chapter 20 of the Alaska Statutes to protect and preserve the natural habitat and game population or to enhance habitat for particular wildlife species. Most of these areas are managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. State Park Areas - Includes parks, marine parks, recreation areas, state preserves, and special management areas. They are established under Title 41, Chapter 21 of the Alaska Statutes to foster the growth and development of a system of parks and recreational facilities and opportunities in the state, for the general health, welfare, education, and enjoyment of its citizens and for the attraction of visitors to the state. Most of these areas are managed by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. State Forest Areas - Includes state forests and resource management areas. They are established under Title 41, Chapter 15 or Chapter 17 of the Alaska Statutes primarily for management of forest resources. These areas are managed by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry. Other State Multiple Use Areas - Includes public use areas, recreation rivers, and recreational mining areas.

However, because of the relatively small number of reported pedestrian crashes in the crash data file, the clustering analysis used crashes from the ten year period from 2007 - 2017.

Urban Growth Area,"Grant County, Washington | Admin_GrantCoWA","One of the first steps in the implementation of the Growth Management Act (GMA) is for counties and their cities to designate urban growth areas (UGAs), “within which urban growth shall be encouraged, and outside of which growth can occur only if it is not urban in nature.” RCW 36.70A.110 and WAC 365-195-335 provide clear criteria for designating urban growth boundaries around a city or a group of cities. Each urban growth area in a county should include enough land to accommodate the Washington State Office of Financial Management’s 20-year population projection allocated for thatUGA. The UGA should also include adequate land for industrial and commercial activities, open space, and other public facilities. A land capacity analysis should be conducted to determine if there is sufficient land included in the UGA for all these uses. A market factor can be built in to this analysis to compensate for the fact that only a portion of the land will be available for sale and development over the planning period. Within the UGA, a city and/or county is to designate sufficient open space, provide urban services, and permit development at urban densities. Urban development and provision of urban services, such as water and sewer, should not generally occur outside of urban growth areas. RCW 36.70A.130(3) requires counties and cities to review, at least every ten years, designated UGAs, the densities permitted within each UGA, and the nature of development that has occurred. UGAs and comprehensive plans are to be revised to accommodate the urban growth projected for the succeeding twenty-year period.",Feature Layer,"April 1, 2020",16,"['UGA', 'urban growth', 'Growth Management', 'Grant County', 'WA', 'land use planning']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/GrantCountyWA::urban-growth-area,2020-04-01

The zoning code classifies, designates, and regulates the development of land for agriculture, mineral resource extraction, residential, commercial, industrial, recreation, tourism and public land uses for the unincorporated area of Grant County.Last update1/17/2020 – Comprehensive plan amendments of 2019:Parcel    201542000 converted from Urban Commercial 2 to Urban Residential 1Parcel    201358008 converted from Rural Residential 1 to AgriculturalParcel    160788000 converted from Rural Residential 1 to Urban Residential 2Parcel    151107000 converted from Rural Residential 1 to AgriculturalParcel    170983000 converted from Rural Remote to Urban Heavy IndustrialParcel    313169000 converted from Rural Urban Reserve to Urban Commercial 2Parcel    211912000 converted from Agricultural to Rural Residential 15/17/2019 – the boundary between AG and RC was corrected to follow the north parcel line of 201370001.

Comprehensive Plan,"Grant County, Washington | Admin_GrantCoWA","The Comprehensive Plan’s purpose and intent is to provide for local needs relating to the use of land and infrastructure, including the protection of property and water rights, and in so doing, to meet the State’s minimum planning law requirements. Comprehensive planning for Grant County will help ensure that the following goals will be accomplished:Tax dollars invested in public roads, water and sewer systems, fire stations, parks and other public services are spent wisely.Funding for development and capital improvement projects is secured. Long-range considerations are incorporated into decisions on short-range actions.Public interests, and the interest of the community at large, are promoted rather than the interests of individuals or special groups within the communities.Interests of property owners are protected.The analyses of existing conditions, issues, facilities, population projections, and other factors within the Comprehensive Plan will aid Grant County officials and the County Commissioners in their decision-making role. It seeks to establish a clear intent and policy base that can be used to develop and interpret municipal regulations. The Comprehensive Plan is also intended to maintain reasonable continuity in future decision-making as turnover occurs within the County's legislative body. However, the plan must be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect technological, social, economic, and political changes that may invalidate certain plans and policies.The Comprehensive Plan provides a legally recognized framework for making decisions about land use and other planning and policy priorities; however, it is fundamentally a policy document providing direction for how land use goals, policies, and regulations should be applied for the next 10 to 20 years in Grant County. The policies are required by the GMA to be implemented through the use of such regulatory tools as zoning and subdivision ordinances, as well as other innovative techniques. These regulations must be developed and maintained in accordance with the goals and policies of this Comprehensive Plan.Last update 1/17/2020.

Edwards Aquifer Land Use/Land Cover,Texas Commission on Environmental Quality | TCEQadmin,"delineates the land use/land cover (LULC) polygons for the Edwards Aquifer Project in Texas from the years 1995 and 1996. Attribution of the polygons is based on a modified Anderson classification schema. LULC classification was done to Level 3 of the classification schema and a new category of Mixed Forest/Shrub was added to better represent the land cover of the area. Fieldwork was performed prior to compilation to gather local data and relate aerial photo images to corresponding ground features. Because of the stunted or lower tree growth common in this region it was difficult at times to differentiate between Forest, Mixed Forest/Shrub, and Shrub. It should be noted that much of the Planted/cultivated land is highly managed pastureland.",Feature Layer,"March 18, 2020","30,593","['TCEQ', 'public', 'land use', 'land cover']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/TCEQ::edwards-aquifer-land-use-land-cover,2020-03-18

The IBA Programme of BirdLife International is a worldwide initiative aimed at identifying and protecting a network of sites, critical for the conservation of the world's birds. These sites were selected on the basis of the bird numbers and species complements they hold. IBAs are particularly important for species that congregate in large numbers, such as wintering and passage waterbirds and breeding seabirds. Many sites have also been identified for species of global, and European/EU conservation concern.

Top 200 Intersections Crash Clusters 2014-2016,Massachusetts geoDOT | massDOT_GIS,"2014 - 2016 Top 200 Intersection Crash Cluster Locations.The top locations where reported collisions occurred have been identified. The crash cluster analysis methodology for the crashes uses a fixed meter search distance of 25 meters (82 ft.) to merge crash clusters together. The analysis method finds nearby crashes and merges their areas together, thus creating clusters. If two distinct clusters are found to share a common crash, the two clusters are merged into a single cluster. This method of search-and-merge results in a set of many distinct clusters of different sizes and shapes  Furthermore, the methodology uses the Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) weighting to rank the clusters.  Additionally, due to the large geographic area encompassed by the crash clusters, it was difficult to name them so they were left unnamed but can be viewed spatially. A review of each location was required to make that determination of the top at grade intersection clusters. Generally, a location was determined to be an “intersection” if the cluster did not contain roadways with grade separation (interchange) nor weaving sections (rotaries or ramps). Intersections located at the ends of off-ramps or traffic circles/rotaries were generally not included. The clusters were reviewed in descending EPDO order until 200 locations were obtained.",Feature Layer,"May 20, 2019","1,132","['crash clusters', 'top 200', 'crashes', 'MassDOT']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::top-200-intersections-crash-clusters-2014-2016,2019-05-20

Areas that would allow people to travel to and from many different destinations would receive a high score. Certain social factors related to income, car ownership, English proficiency, minority status, disability status, and age indicate where there may be concentrations of people with limited transportation options and who stand to benefit from increased access to safe, connected, and accessible pedestrian infrastructure.
