This is a subset of all parcels being tracked with open code violations in the code enforcement database. The operational purpose of this data is to allow code inspectors to track and monitor properties with open violations, of which vacant structures are a particular focus due to their negative impact on neighborhoods. This information is also used collaboratively by the Fire Department when Code Enforcement initiates the boarding up of properties to secure them from entry, and for the Fire Department to track properties at higher risk for fire.About Vacant Structures:Vacant structures can have a negative impact on the quality of life for the surrounding neighborhood.  Blighted vacant structures and those which are insecure and have poorly maintained exteriors and yards can have a compounding effect on our resident's ability to sustain or enhance their neighborhood.  As such, the City of Rochester has an aggressive policy of monitoring vacant structures as per §90-17 of the City Code.",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020","1,740","['Land', 'Live', 'Neighborhoods', 'Property', 'Housing', 'City Owned', 'City Owned Properties', 'Land Use', 'Inspectors', 'Rochester', 'Open Data', 'Vacant', 'Inspection', 'Parcels', 'Supply', 'Properties', 'Real Estate', 'Vacancy', 'NBD', 'Services']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/RochesterNY::code-enforcement-vacant-structures-live,2020-09-10

This dataset is also used by analysts to assess geographic trends and patterns with code issues across neighborhoods. The data includes address, ownership, date of the oldest open code violation, and other details.About Code Enforcement:The City of Rochester has numerous residential, commercial and industrial buildings which are substantially sound and habitable structures which provide housing resources for residents and businesses in the city.  The condition and timely maintenance of these existing structures as well as the safe and code compliant construction of newly built buildings play a vital role in the success of our businesses and city neighborhoods.  In order to preserve these valuable housing and business resources in the city, to enhance the residential neighborhoods and to protect the safety, health and welfare of the persons who live, work and recreate in the city, the Division of Code Enforcement conducts property and building code inspections and performs necessary code enforcement activity. There are many aspects of code enforcement; each is uniquely designed to further encourage compliance.  The actions taken by a Code Enforcement Officer (CEO) are dependent upon the specific situation and may include but are not limited to the:Voiding of a permit;Issuance of a Notice and Order;Issuance of a stop work order;Issuance of an immediate ticket;Issuance of a final letter;Issuance of housing code tickets;The vacating of a unit which poses an immediate hazard to the occupants;Executing a work order to remove trash, cut grass or secure a vacant building;Scheduling of a Warning meeting in the Law Department;Application for Judicial Inspection Warrant;Commencement of a proceeding in City Court;Commencement of a proceeding in State Supreme Court;Pursuit of an order of DemolitionFor more information visit the City of Rochester's Code Inspection and Enforcement website and the Permit Inspection website.",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020","8,728","['Land', 'Open Data', 'Structures', 'Code Compliant', 'Live', 'Property', 'Buildings', 'Polygon', 'NBD', 'Rochester', 'Services']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/RochesterNY::code-enforcement-open-case-parcels-live,2020-09-10

8,Loudoun Street Centerline,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More Metadata Street centerline was originally developed from the road features on the County's 1:2400 base map. Both address range and a link to street names are included as data attributes. The current data is collected from recorded plats in DXF format or is digitized from plats. The data covers the entire County as well as the incorporated Towns. Purpose: The street centerline coverage was originally developed to support addressing. Fire & Rescue Services and the Sheriff's Office use the address range information for Emergency 911 dispatching; it is also used to update U.S. Census Bureau Tiger data in support of the decennial census. Supplemental Information: Centerline data are maintained from plats and site plans prepared by engineering and surveying firms. Although street centerline is the most current of the County's street data, deviation in construction after plat submittal and recordation may cause centerline to differ from similar County layer, road casing. Centerline contains the most current data; road casing is spatially more accurate because it is updated photogrammetrically. These data are not intended to be used for local surveys or at a scale larger than 1:2400. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: Data is updated on a daily basis.

9,Loudoun Parcels,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More MetadataA parcel is a tract or plot of land surveyed and defined by legal ownership. Data were compiled from plats and deeds recorded at the Clerk of the Court and from historic tax maps. Source material was digitized or the coordinates were entered into the database via ARC/INFO Coordinate Geometry (COGO). Digital data from engineering companies has also been incorporated for newer subdivisions. A MCPI number is used to identify each parcel, which is a unique ID number further explained below. Purpose: Parcels are used to support a variety of services including assessment, permitting, subdivision review, planning, zoning, and economic development. Parcel data were initially developed to replace existing tax maps. As a result, there are parcel polygons digitized from tax maps that do not represent land parcels but are taxable entities such as leaseholds or easements. Supplemental Information: Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: Parcels are updated on an hourly basis from recorded deeds and plats. Depending on volume and date of receipt of recordation information, data may be updated 2-3 weeks following recordation. Completeness Report: Features may have been eliminated or generalized due to scale and intended use. To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data. MCPI: 9 digit unique parcel ID that is a combination of: MAP, CELL, and PARCEL. MAP: 3 digit map number (001-701) corresponding with map tile index. CELL: 2 digit map grid location of parcel center; the grid is comprised of 1000 by 1000 ft grid cells numbered as rows and columns (Columns numbered > 5 6 7 8 9 0; Rows numbered > 1 2 3 4). PARCEL: 4 digit location of polygon center based on the 1927 Virginia State Plane coordinate grid where an easting and northing measurement is taken. example: 6654 from: E 2229668 N475545. The MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values of a parcel do not change when a parcel is altered by a boundary line adjustment or becomes residue from a subdivision. The MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values may therefore be inconsistent with the location of polygon center. MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values have been manually altered for some parcels to agree with other databases; as a result, not all parcels can be located by the MAP, CELL, and PARCEL values.

This metric discourages repeat behavior. “Hot spot” areas frequently targeted by graffiti vandals are patrolled regularly with the overall goal of removing graffiti as soon as possible.  In addition, the approach to data gathering and measuring has improved exponentially through the use of Tempe’s emerging Enterprise GIS system.Contact: Sue TaaffeContact E-Mail: sue_taaffe@tempe.govContact Phone: 480-350-8663Link: https://www.tempe.gov/city-hall/public-works/transportation/streets-traffic-opsData Source: SQL Server/ArcGIS ServerData Source Type: GeospatialPreparation Method: N/APublish Frequency: DailyPublish Method: AutomaticData DictionaryPMID: 4089",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020","19,433","['Graffiti Abatement', 'Public Works', 'Public Works', 'Transportation', 'Traffic Operations']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tempegov::graffiti-abatement-incidents,2020-09-10

Each publicly or privately owned property in the city of Rochester has an official tax parcel record. The assessed value of every tax parcel in the city is recalculated based on recent sales and professional appraisals every four years. Reassessment years provide the best snapshot period for historical comparison, and included on the open data portal are 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. This feature layer shows the polygon boundaries for each of the over 65,000 tax parcels in the city, along with several fields from their parcel records that detail information about the property, including ownership, property type, and assessed values. How does the tax map system work in New York State? What does Section, Block, Lot refer to?Each county in the state has a tax map that includes all of the parcels in each of its cities, towns, and villages. The county tax map is subdivided into sections of even, modular units that are 8,000 feet by 12,000 feet. Each of these sections are then subdivided into blocks of up to 100 parcels. Blocks are typically formed by following natural boundaries (i.e., roads, rivers, railroad tracks). Lot numbers are assigned to each parcel in a block following a set pattern according to their location on the map. Each parcel is thus assigned a Section, Block, Lot (SBL) number for identification and tax administration purposes.

These layers are updated as new preliminary and pending data becomes available, and data is removed from these layers as it becomes effective.For more information, please visit FEMA's website.To download map panels or GIS Data, go to: NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.Preliminary & Pending DataPreliminary data are for review and guidance purposes only. By viewing preliminary data and maps, the user acknowledges that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. Preliminary data are not final and are presented in this national layer as the best information available at this time. Additionally, preliminary data cannot be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove preliminary data once pending data are available.Pending data are for early awareness of upcoming changes to regulatory flood map information. Until the data becomes effective, when it will appear in FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), the data should not be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove pending data once effective data are available.To better understand Preliminary data please see the View Your Community's Preliminary Flood Hazard Data webpage.FEMA GeoPlatformFEMA's GIS flood map services are available through FEMAs GeoPlatform, an ArcGIS Online portal containing a variety of FEMA-related data.To view the NFHL on the FEMA GeoPlatform go to NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.To view the Preliminary and Pending national layers on the FEMA Geoplatform go to FEMA's Preliminary & Pending National Flood Hazard Layer.Technical InformationFlood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the NFHL with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. United States Geological Survey (USGS) imagery and map services that meet this standard can be found by visiting the Knowledge Sharing Site (KSS) for Base Map Standards (420). Other base map standards can be found at https://riskmapportal.msc.fema.gov/kss/MapChanges/default.aspx. You will need a username and password to access this information.The NFHL data are from FEMA’s FIRM databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains map changes to FIRM data made by LOMRs.The NFHL is stored in North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system, though many of the NFHL GIS web services support the Web Mercator Sphere projection commonly used in web mapping applications.Organization & DisplayThe NFHL is organized into many data layers. The layers display information at map scales appropriate for the data. A layer indicating the availability of NFHL data is displayed at map scales smaller than 1:250,000, regional overviews at map scales between 1:250,000 and 1:50,000, and detailed flood hazard maps at map scales of 1:50,000 and larger. The ""Scalehint"" item in the Capabilities file for the Web Map Service encodes the scale range for a layer.In addition, there are non-NFHL datasets provided in the GIS web services, such as information about the availability of flood data and maps, the national map panel scheme, and point locations for LOMA and LOMR-Fs.

187,Recent Real Estate Sales Parcels: Live,"City of Rochester, NY | Open_Data_Admin","Overview of the Data:This is a subset of tax parcel records for only parcels sold within the last three calendar years. Sales are recorded through deed transfers by the Monroe County Clerk and this data is shared with the City. The operational purpose of the tax parcel data set is to facilitate the calculation and collection of property taxes. Each publicly or privately owned property in the city of Rochester has an official tax parcel record. The assessed value of every tax parcel in the city is recalculated based on recent sales and professional appraisals every four years. Reassessment years provide the best snapshot period for historical comparison, and included on the open data portal are 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. This feature layer shows the polygon boundaries for each of the over 65,000 tax parcels in the city, along with several fields from their parcel records that detail information about the property, including ownership, property type, and assessed values. How does the tax map system work in New York State? What does Section, Block, Lot refer to?Each county in the state has a tax map that includes all of the parcels in each of its cities, towns, and villages. The county tax map is subdivided into sections of even, modular units that are 8,000 feet by 12,000 feet. Each of these sections are then subdivided into blocks of up to 100 parcels. Blocks are typically formed by following natural boundaries (i.e., roads, rivers, railroad tracks). Lot numbers are assigned to each parcel in a block following a set pattern according to their location on the map. Each parcel is thus assigned a Section, Block, Lot (SBL) number for identification and tax administration purposes. For more information on this identification system, please see the General Guide for Tax Mapping in New York State, put out by the Property Tax Assessment Administration.Related Resources:For a searchable interactive mapping application, please visit the City of Rochester's Property Information explorer tool.

276,Loudoun Cemeteries,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More MetadataHistoric cemeteries and burial grounds are fragile, tangible heritage resources that connect residents and visitors to their Loudoun roots. As development projects have been approved in the county over the years, these resources have been impacted. In some cases they have been inadvertently destroyed. In other cases, graves have been moved to other burial locations to make way for construction projects. While the County has kept some records of known cemeteries and burial grounds, there has never been a systematic effort to consolidate locational information into a publicly accessible database. In the Spring of 2018, the Board of Supervisors (BOS) directed County staff to create such a database that could provide residents, researchers, and developers with cemetery and burial ground locations as a means of ensuring that these resources are protected and preserved. Purpose: This dataset contains historic cemetery locations as point feature and basic cemetery attributes. Supplemental Information: Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a point feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. Maintenance and Update Frequency: As Needed Completeness Report: To assist Loudoun County, Virginia in the maintenance of the data, please provide any information concerning discovered errors, omissions, or other discrepancies found in the data. The historic cemetery data are based on field reports which have been submitted by many and varied individuals, groups, institutions, and cultural resource firms. Submissions to the Site File are sometimes accepted from amateurs as well as professionals. The locations are only as accurate as the locational information submitted to the Site File by the site recorder. The accuracy of submitted information cannot always be verified. The absence of a cultural resource in this data layer does not preclude the existence of an unrecorded resource in the field. The cemeteries recorded at the Site File represent only a fraction of the historic cemeteries present statewide. The locations of archaeological sites, historic structures, unmarked human burials, cemeteries, and other cultural features contained in this and other Site File data layers are for resource management, law enforcement, and research purposes only. Cemeteries located on private property have restricted access to specific individuals (such as family members or descendants of those buried there) with advanced notice to the landowner, who may designate the frequency of access, hours and duration of access, and the access route.

The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey conducted by the federal government that provides vital information annually about America and its population. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year.For more information about the Census Bureau's ACS data and process of constructing the survey, visit the ACS's About page.About the City's Data Divisions:As a planning analytic tool, an interdepartmental working group divided Rochester into 12 “data divisions.” These divisions are well-defined and static so they are positioned to be used by the City of Rochester for statistical and planning purposes. Census data is tied to these divisions and serves as the basis for analyses over time. As such, the data divisions are designed to follow census boundaries, while also recognizing natural and human-made boundaries, such as the River, rail lines, and highways. Historical neighborhood boundaries, while informative in the division process, did not drive the boundaries. Data divisions are distinct from the numerous neighborhoods in Rochester. Neighborhood boundaries, like quadrant boundaries, police precincts, and legislative districts often change, which makes statistical analysis challenging when looking at data over time. The data division boundaries, however, are intended to remain unchanged.  It is hoped that over time, all City data analysts will adopt the data divisions for the purpose of measuring change over time throughout the city.",Feature Layer,"August 10, 2020",18,"['Data Division', 'Census', 'ACS', 'Demographics', 'Workforce', 'Race', 'Income']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/RochesterNY::census-acs-data-at-the-city-of-rochester-data-division-level,2020-08-10

425,Tax Foreclosure Code Enforcement Parcels: Live,"City of Rochester, NY | Open_Data_Admin","Please note: this data is live (updated nightly) to reflect the latest changes in the City's systems of record.Overview of the Data:The operational purpose of the tax foreclosure parcel data set is to facilitate proactive code inspections efforts. Tax foreclosure parcels are properties that have become tax delinquent by not paying their taxes for over a year. These properties are more likely to be vacant and abandoned and have significant code violations and thus are targeted for proactive enforcement. This list is a subset of tax foreclosure properties that also have an open code violation. The list of properties in tax foreclosure is provided by the City's Treasury Bureau to the Bureau of Buildings and Zoning in January each year. GIS analysts update the code enforcement database to mark properties in tax foreclosure to provide inspectors the information they need to monitor these properties. How does the tax foreclosure process work?Each year, the City of Rochester holds a Tax Foreclosure Auction. The auction typically takes place in November.  Unlike surplus auctions (on properties the City owns), these auctions are for properties where their respective owners have not paid several years of taxes. The starting bid is the balance due to the City. Properties can be residential, vacant lots, parking lots, mixed use, and commercial buildings.  There are no pre-qualification requirements (unlike the surplus auctions), but you must show up to the auction with a deposit of $1,000 and pay the remaining balance by the following week. The preliminary list of properties is published in a local newspaper for 4 consecutive weeks leading up to the auction. The list is subject to change until the commencement of the auction, as property owners are given the opportunity to pay their taxes right up until the property is auctioned.

The county tax map is subdivided into sections of even, modular units that are 8,000 feet by 12,000 feet. Each of these sections are then subdivided into blocks of up to 100 parcels. Blocks are typically formed by following natural boundaries (i.e., roads, rivers, railroad tracks). Lot numbers are assigned to each parcel in a block following a set pattern according to their location on the map. Each parcel is thus assigned a Section, Block, Lot (SBL) number for identification and tax administration purposes. For more information on this identification system, please see the General Guide for Tax Mapping in New York State, put out by the Property Tax Assessment Administration.Related Resources:For a searchable interactive mapping application, please visit the City of Rochester's Property Information explorer tool.

The 2010 Census tract boundaries are used for Census Bureau statistical data tabulation purposes, including the 2010 Decennial Census and American Community Surveys.Census tracts are part of the sub-county census geography hierarchy of tracts, block groups, and blocks. The three census geographies nest to each other, forming a hierarchy of census tract, followed by block groups, and then blocks, with blocks being the smallest. A census tract consists of one or more census block groups and is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract. Tracts are uniquely identified within a County by a six digit number. The last two digits will be zeros unless earlier divisions of the census tract occurred as a result of population growth.Loudoun County's tracts were delineated by Loudoun County Government during the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program for the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census tract layer has been modified from the Census Bureau's Tiger line file. Users should be aware that the Census's Tiger line data is devised from a mix of national and local GIS data sets. When the Tiger line data is overlaid with Loudoun County Government's detailed GIS layers it can be determined that the Census Bureau's Tiger line boundaries in some cases are slightly off from the actual location of the physical features, natural features, and governmental units such as town boundaries that they are designated to follow.

485,Topographic Low Confidence Areas,"City of Rochester, NY | Open_Data_Admin","FEMA provides access to the National Flood Hazards Layer (NFHL) through web mapping services. The maps depict effective flood hazard information and supporting data. The primary flood hazard classification is indicated in the Flood Hazard Zones layer.The NFHL layers include:Flood hazard zones and labelsRiver Miles MarkersCross-sections and coastal transects and their labelsLetter of Map Revision (LOMR) boundaries and case numbersFlood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) boundaries, labels and effective datesCoastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) and Otherwise Protected Area (OPA) unitsCommunity boundaries and namesLeveesHydraulic and flood control structuresProfile and coastal transect baselinesLimit of Moderate Wave Action(LiMWA)Not all effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) have GIS data available. To view a list of available county and single-jurisdiction flood study data in GIS format and check the status of the NFHL GIS services, please visit the NFHL Status Page.Preliminary & Pending National Flood Hazard LayersThe Preliminary and Pending NFHL dataset represents the current pre-effective flood data for the country. These layers are updated as new preliminary and pending data becomes available, and data is removed from these layers as it becomes effective.For more information, please visit FEMA's website.To download map panels or GIS Data, go to: NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.Preliminary & Pending DataPreliminary data are for review and guidance purposes only. By viewing preliminary data and maps, the user acknowledges that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. Preliminary data are not final and are presented in this national layer as the best information available at this time. Additionally, preliminary data cannot be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove preliminary data once pending data are available.Pending data are for early awareness of upcoming changes to regulatory flood map information. Until the data becomes effective, when it will appear in FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), the data should not be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove pending data once effective data are available.To better understand Preliminary data please see the View Your Community's Preliminary Flood Hazard Data webpage.FEMA GeoPlatformFEMA's GIS flood map services are available through FEMAs GeoPlatform, an ArcGIS Online portal containing a variety of FEMA-related data.To view the NFHL on the FEMA GeoPlatform go to NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.To view the Preliminary and Pending national layers on the FEMA Geoplatform go to FEMA's Preliminary & Pending National Flood Hazard Layer.Technical InformationFlood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the NFHL with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. United States Geological Survey (USGS) imagery and map services that meet this standard can be found by visiting the Knowledge Sharing Site (KSS) for Base Map Standards (420). Other base map standards can be found at https://riskmapportal.msc.fema.gov/kss/MapChanges/default.aspx. You will need a username and password to access this information.The NFHL data are from FEMA’s FIRM databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains map changes to FIRM data made by LOMRs.The NFHL is stored in North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system, though many of the NFHL GIS web services support the Web Mercator Sphere projection commonly used in web mapping applications.Organization & DisplayThe NFHL is organized into many data layers. The layers display information at map scales appropriate for the data. A layer indicating the availability of NFHL data is displayed at map scales smaller than 1:250,000, regional overviews at map scales between 1:250,000 and 1:50,000, and detailed flood hazard maps at map scales of 1:50,000 and larger.

531,Loudoun County Boundary,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More MetadataLoudoun County was founded in 1757. Loudoun's boundary with Maryland is the mean low water mark of the Potomac River on the Virginia side; it has not been surveyed. Loudoun's boundary with Prince William County is the Bull Run Creek. The border has not been modified for recent surveys. Individual plats along the Potomac and Bull Run Rivers have not resulted in a change in the border along those rivers- since measurements of the waters edge vary seasonally and the County Boundary needs to be seamless and constant. Many decades ago tax commissioners from surrounding jurisdictions assigned parcels to one jurisdiction or another rather than splitting parcels. Currently there is a mix of parcels split by a County Boundary, parcels taxed entirely in Loudoun, and portions of parcels within the County but taxed by another jurisdiction. The Office of the Commissioner of the Revenue dictates how these parcels are taxed, as do other jurisdictions. In 1957, the boundary with Fairfax County was re-established and finalized. The boundary with Fauquier County was surveyed and monumented in 1966. The boundary with Clarke County was surveyed in 1989, and the boundary survey with Jefferson County West Virginia was completed in 1998. The West Virginia, Fairfax, Fauquier, and Clarke boundary arcs were created by generating coverages from the monument coordinates using the generate command.",Feature Layer,"July 2, 2020",1,"['open data', 'Land Records', 'county boundary', 'Loudoun County', 'county border', 'county line', 'base layers']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/LoudounGIS::loudoun-county-boundary,2020-07-02

566,Posted Seasonal Load Restrictions Public View,Authoritative_mto_on_ca,"Seasonal Loads & Winter Weight PremiumsUnder Section 122(5) of the Highway Traffic Act, the province enforces reduced load restrictions on trucks to protect Ontario’s highways during spring thaw, when road damage is most likely to occur.During a reduced load period signs are posted on restricted highways, limiting axle weight for commercial motor vehicles and/or trailers to 5,000 kilograms. Signs are posted five days in advance of the start of a restriction period.Restriction periods are divided into three categories (Schedules), with start/end dates varying between March 1st and June 30th. Actual restriction dates imposed vary by highway, and are dependent on individual road freeze/thaw conditions, which are evaluated regionally.Enforcing load restrictions during the spring thaw period is a cost effective method of maximizing pavement service life while mitigating the economic impacts to the transportation industry, particularly those involved in the transportation of raw forest products.Restrictions must be posted five days in advance of their effect, which requires a conservative assessment that may restrict commercial traffic more than is necessary according to the physical conditions of the roadway.During the winter months, the strength of the pavement structure increases, as does its carrying capacity, as a result of frost development. Commercial vehicles using these roads are permitted to increase their payloads by 10%, as a Winter Weight Premium (Raw Forest Product Allowance).It is important that the ministry maintain a balance between protecting its road system while minimizing impacts to industry, by setting and lifting these restrictions as accurately as possible.Highways on this layer will be colour-coded based on current restriction status found in the Status_Colour field:0 = No Restrictions1 = 5 Day Warning Period2 = Restrictions in Place3 = Raw Forest Product Allowance in PlaceRestrictions are imposed in 5 separate geographical areas, as per the Highway Traffic Area, and are essentially divided as follows:Zone 1A – Northwestern Region (northern portion)Zone 1B – Northwestern Region (southern portion)Zone 2A – Northeast Region (northern portion)Zone 2B – Northeast Region (southern portion)Zone 3 – Northeast Region (Huntsville area)",Feature Layer,"June 1, 2020",141,"['SLR - 5 Day Warning', 'Roads', 'Seasonal', 'Restrictions', 'Highways', 'Winter Weight Premiums', 'ArcGIS', 'Service Definition', '.sd', 'Ministry of Transportation Ontario', 'Open Data', 'Traveller Information', 'Ontario 511']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a5c6e3674c604a19865d3eba0c2b9aee_0,2020-06-01

These layers are updated as new preliminary and pending data becomes available, and data is removed from these layers as it becomes effective.For more information, please visit FEMA's website.To download map panels or GIS Data, go to: NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.Preliminary & Pending DataPreliminary data are for review and guidance purposes only. By viewing preliminary data and maps, the user acknowledges that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. Preliminary data are not final and are presented in this national layer as the best information available at this time. Additionally, preliminary data cannot be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove preliminary data once pending data are available.Pending data are for early awareness of upcoming changes to regulatory flood map information. Until the data becomes effective, when it will appear in FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), the data should not be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove pending data once effective data are available.To better understand Preliminary data please see the View Your Community's Preliminary Flood Hazard Data webpage.FEMA GeoPlatformFEMA's GIS flood map services are available through FEMAs GeoPlatform, an ArcGIS Online portal containing a variety of FEMA-related data.To view the NFHL on the FEMA GeoPlatform go to NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.To view the Preliminary and Pending national layers on the FEMA Geoplatform go to FEMA's Preliminary & Pending National Flood Hazard Layer.Technical InformationFlood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the NFHL with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. United States Geological Survey (USGS) imagery and map services that meet this standard can be found by visiting the Knowledge Sharing Site (KSS) for Base Map Standards (420). Other base map standards can be found at https://riskmapportal.msc.fema.gov/kss/MapChanges/default.aspx. You will need a username and password to access this information.The NFHL data are from FEMA’s FIRM databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains map changes to FIRM data made by LOMRs.The NFHL is stored in North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system, though many of the NFHL GIS web services support the Web Mercator Sphere projection commonly used in web mapping applications.Organization & DisplayThe NFHL is organized into many data layers. The layers display information at map scales appropriate for the data. A layer indicating the availability of NFHL data is displayed at map scales smaller than 1:250,000, regional overviews at map scales between 1:250,000 and 1:50,000, and detailed flood hazard maps at map scales of 1:50,000 and larger.

These layers are updated as new preliminary and pending data becomes available, and data is removed from these layers as it becomes effective.For more information, please visit FEMA's website.To download map panels or GIS Data, go to: NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.Preliminary & Pending DataPreliminary data are for review and guidance purposes only. By viewing preliminary data and maps, the user acknowledges that the information provided is preliminary and subject to change. Preliminary data are not final and are presented in this national layer as the best information available at this time. Additionally, preliminary data cannot be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove preliminary data once pending data are available.Pending data are for early awareness of upcoming changes to regulatory flood map information. Until the data becomes effective, when it will appear in FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL), the data should not be used to rate flood insurance policies or enforce the Federal mandatory purchase requirement. FEMA will remove pending data once effective data are available.To better understand Preliminary data please see the View Your Community's Preliminary Flood Hazard Data webpage.FEMA GeoPlatformFEMA's GIS flood map services are available through FEMAs GeoPlatform, an ArcGIS Online portal containing a variety of FEMA-related data.To view the NFHL on the FEMA GeoPlatform go to NFHL on FEMA GeoPlatform.To view the Preliminary and Pending national layers on the FEMA Geoplatform go to FEMA's Preliminary & Pending National Flood Hazard Layer.Technical InformationFlood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000–scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the NFHL with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA’s standards for map accuracy.The minimum horizontal positional accuracy for base map hydrographic and transportation features used with the NFHL is the NSSDA radial accuracy of 38 feet. United States Geological Survey (USGS) imagery and map services that meet this standard can be found by visiting the Knowledge Sharing Site (KSS) for Base Map Standards (420). Other base map standards can be found at https://riskmapportal.msc.fema.gov/kss/MapChanges/default.aspx. You will need a username and password to access this information.The NFHL data are from FEMA’s FIRM databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains map changes to FIRM data made by LOMRs.The NFHL is stored in North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system, though many of the NFHL GIS web services support the Web Mercator Sphere projection commonly used in web mapping applications.Organization & DisplayThe NFHL is organized into many data layers. The layers display information at map scales appropriate for the data. A layer indicating the availability of NFHL data is displayed at map scales smaller than 1:250,000, regional overviews at map scales between 1:250,000 and 1:50,000, and detailed flood hazard maps at map scales of 1:50,000 and larger. The ""Scalehint"" item in the Capabilities file for the Web Map Service encodes the scale range for a layer.In addition, there are non-NFHL datasets provided in the GIS web services, such as information about the availability of flood data and maps, the national map panel scheme, and point locations for LOMA and LOMR-Fs. The LOMA are positioned less accurately than are the NFHL data.Layers in the public NFHL GIS services:Use the numbers shown below when referencing layers by number.0. NFHL Availability1. LOMRs2.

708,Housing Market Study Typologies,"City of Rochester, NY | Open_Data_Admin","DisclaimerBefore using this layer, please review the 2018 Rochester Citywide Housing Market Study for the full background and context that is required for interpreting and portraying this data. Please click here to access the study.  Please also note that the housing market typologies were based on analysis of property data from 2008 to 2018, and is a snapshot of market conditions within that time frame. For an accurate depiction of current housing market typologies, this analysis would need to be redone with the latest available data.About the DataThis is a polygon feature layer containing the boundaries of all census blockgroups in the city of Rochester. Beyond the unique identifier fields including GEOID, the only other field is the housing market typology for that blockgroup.Information from the 2018 Housing Market Study- Housing Market TypologiesThe City of Rochester commissioned a Citywide Housing Market Study in 2018 as a technical study to inform development of the City's new Comprehensive Plan, Rochester 2034, and retained czb, LLC – a firm with national expertise based in Alexandria, VA – to perform the analysis.Any understanding of Rochester’s housing market – and any attempt to develop strategies to influence the market in ways likely to achieve community goals – must begin with recognition that market conditions in the city are highly uneven. On some blocks, competition for real estate is strong and expressed by pricing and investment levels that are above city averages. On other blocks, private demand is much lower and expressed by above average levels of disinvestment and physical distress. Still other blocks are in the middle – both in terms of condition of housing and prevailing prices. These block-by-block differences are obvious to most residents and shape their options, preferences, and actions as property owners and renters. Importantly, these differences shape the opportunities and challenges that exist in each neighborhood, the types of policy and investment tools to utilize in response to specific needs, and the level and range of available resources, both public and private, to meet those needs. The City of Rochester has long recognized that a one-size-fits-all approach to housing and neighborhood strategy is inadequate in such a diverse market environment and that is no less true today. To concisely describe distinct market conditions and trends across the city in this study, a Housing Market Typology was developed using a wide range of indicators to gauge market health and investment behaviors. This section of the Citywide Housing Market Study introduces the typology and its components. In later sections, the typology is used as a tool for describing and understanding demographic and economic patterns within the city, the implications of existing market patterns on strategy development, and how existing or potential policy and investment tools relate to market conditions.Overview of Housing Market Typology PurposeThe Housing Market Typology in this study is a tool for understanding recent market conditions and variations within Rochester and informing housing and neighborhood strategy development. As with any typology, it is meant to simplify complex information into a limited number of meaningful categories to guide action. Local context and knowledge remain critical to understanding market conditions and should always be used alongside the typology to maximize its usefulness.Geographic Unit of Analysis The Block Group – a geographic unit determined by the U.S. Census Bureau – is the unit of analysis for this typology, which utilizes parcel-level data. There are over 200 Block Groups in Rochester, most of which cover a small cluster of city blocks and are home to between 600 and 3,000 residents. For this tool, the Block Group provides geographies large enough to have sufficient data to analyze and small enough to reveal market variations within small areas.Four Components for CalculationAnalysis of multiple datasets led to the identification of four typology components that were most helpful in drawing out market variations within the city:• Terms of Sale• Market Strength• Bank Foreclosures• Property DistressThose components are described one-by-one on in the full study document (LINK), with detailed methodological descriptions provided in the Appendix.A Spectrum of Demand The four components were folded together to create the Housing Market Typology. The seven categories of the typology describe a spectrum of housing demand – with lower scores indicating higher levels of demand, and higher scores indicating weaker levels of demand. Typology 1 are areas with the highest demand and strongest market, while typology 3 are the weakest markets.

746,1.12 Clearance Rates (summary),City of Tempe | TempeData,"This dataset provides the crime clearance rate nationally and for the City of Tempe. An overall clearance rate is developed as part of the Department’s report for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Report (UCR) Program. The statistics in the UCR Program are based on reports the Tempe Police Department officially submits to the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS).In the UCR Program, there are two ways that a law enforcement agency can report that an offense is cleared:(1) cleared by arrest or solved for crime reporting purposes or(2) cleared by exceptional means.An offense is cleared by arrest, or solved for crime reporting purposes, when three specific conditions have been met. The three conditions are that at least one person has been: (1) arrested; (2) charged with the commission of the offense; and (3) turned over to the court for prosecution.In some situations, an agency may be prevented from arresting and formally charging an offender due to factors outside of the agency's control. In these cases, an offense can be cleared by exceptional means, if the following four conditions are met: (1) identified the offender; (2) gathered enough evidence to support an arrest, make a charge, and turn over the offender to the court for prosecution; (3) identified offender’s exact location so that suspect can immediately be taken into custody; and (4) encountered a circumstance outside law enforcement's control that prohibits arresting, charging and prosecuting the offender.The UCR clearance rate is one tool for helping the police to understand and assess success at investigating crimes. However, these rates should be interpreted with an understanding of the unique challenges faced with reporting and investigating crimes. Clearance rates for a given year may be greater than 100% because a clearance is reported for the year the clearance occurs, which may not be the same year that the crime occurred. Often, investigations may take months or years, resulting in cases being cleared years after the actual offense. Additionally, there may be delays in the reporting of crimes, which would push the clearance of the case out beyond the year it happened.This page provides data for the Violent Cases Clearance Rate performance measure. The performance measure dashboard is available at 1.12 Violent Cases Clearance Rate.Additional InformationSource: Tempe Police Department (TPD) Versadex Records Management System (RMS) submitted to Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZ DPS) who submits data to the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)Contact (author): Noah FritzContact E-Mail (author): Noah_Fritz@tempe.govContact (maintainer): Brooks LoutonContact E-Mail (maintainer): Brooks_Louton@tempe.govData Source Type: ExcelPreparation Method: Drawn from the Annual FBI Crime In the United States PublicationPublish Frequency: AnnuallyPublish Method: ManualData Dictionary",Table,"January 9, 2020",14,"['Safe and Secure Communities', 'Violent Cases Clearance Rate (PM 1.12)', 'UCR', 'crime rate', 'Police', 'police data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tempegov::1-12-clearance-rates-summary,2020-01-09

Congress and HUD do not fund the program to assist all of the families we are allotted to assist. We can only assist the number of families we have the budget to assist.HUD provides an initial funding amount based on what they anticipate they will allocate to housing assistance payments. The actual amount of funding received is subject to change depending on Federal Budget priorities, Congressional approval and many other factors.Expenditures are reported monthly, as HUD requires expenses to be posted in the month they were incurred rather than the month the expense was paid.The performance measure dashboard is available at 3.05 Subsidized Housing Funding Usage.Additional InformationSource: Manually maintained data, Housing Pro and QuickbooksContact: Levon LamyContact E-Mail: Levon_Lamy@tempe.govData Source Type: CSVPreparation Method: Monthly values are calculated by determining the month each of the expenditures was for and retroactivelly accruing the funding use to the appropriate period.

The BCCP provides a streamlined method for private land owners and developers within the BCCP Permit area to mitigate for removal of endangered species habitat and still be in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The black-capped vireo was one of the eight endangered species that the BCCP and Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP) were created to protect in 1996. In May 2018, the vireo was removed from the federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. The delisting does not affect the preserve – the land will continue to be preserved in perpetuity. However, landowners who wish to remove black-capped vireo habitat from their properties are no longer required to mitigate for the removal of that habitat. Before beginning a construction or clearing project, however, please check the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan: Permits and Habitat Fee Zones in TNR-GIS open data to see if there may be endangered golden-cheeked warbler or karst invertebrate habitat on your property.",Feature Layer,"October 30, 2019",24,"['BCCP', 'Black-capped Viero', 'Travis County', 'Preserved Lands', 'Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan', 'Endangered Species']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/TravisCountyTX::black-capped-vireo-habitat,2019-10-30

Deciduous Forest - areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total vegetation cover. More than 75% of the tree species shed foliage simultaneously in response to seasonal change.3. Evergreen Forest - areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total vegetation cover. More than 75% of the tree species maintain their leaves all year. Canopy is never without green foliage.4. Pasture - areas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures planted for livestock grazing or the production of seed or hay crops, typically on a perennial cycle. Pasture/hay vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation.5. Crop - areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, and also perennial woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class also includes all land being actively tilled.6. Open Water - areas of open water, generally with less than 25% cover of vegetation or soil.7. Residential - areas of residential development.8. Commercial/Industrial/Transportation - areas of commercial or industrial development; or areas dedicated for transportation.9. Bare/Mines - areas of bedrock, desert pavement, scarps, talus, slides, volcanic material, glacial debris, sand dunes, strip mines, gravel pits and other accumulations of earthen material. Generally, vegetation accounts for less than 15% of total cover.10. Urban/Recreational Grasses - areas with a mixture of some constructed materials, but mostly vegetation in the form of lawn grasses. Impervious surfaces account for less than 20% of total cover. These areas most commonly include large-lot single-family housing units, parks, golf courses, and vegetation planted in developed settings for recreation, erosion control, or aesthetic purposes.11. Herbaceous Wetlands - Areas where perennial herbaceous vegetation accounts for greater than 80% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water. 12.

947,National Wetlands Inventory (in Stark County),Stark County Ohio | StarkCountyOH,"Wetlands identified by the National Wetlands Inventory within Stark County, Ohio. This layer was originally downloaded in May, 2019, from https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Data-Download.html and clipped to the Stark County boundary. This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands_Project_Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.",Feature Layer,"May 30, 2019","7,767","['Stark County', 'Ohio', 'SCGIS', 'Wetlands', 'Environmental', 'Water', 'Conservation']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/starkcountyohio::national-wetlands-inventory-in-stark-county,2019-05-30

This layer also includes stormwater storage structures that predate NPDES requirements.Common Types of BMPsBioretention, Bioswale, Rain Garden - Bioretention BMPs, including bioswales (vegetated swales), and rain gardens, utilize landscaped areas of plants that control water quality and quantity. Bioretention areas are typically used as islands in parking lots to provide vegetation to absorb runoff. These areas typically include underdrains.Detention Pond (Dry) - A dry pond or detention basin is a depression used to temporarily store stormwater. It has no permanent pool.Exfiltration Basin or Trench - Exfiltration areas capture and redirect stormwater runoff. Green Parking or Roof - Green parking lots and roofs use natural vegetation to absorb stormwater runoff from traditionally impermeable surfaces. Green roofs are typically layered, with an underlying structural component and the ""green"" component on top to manage runoff.Infiltration Basin or Trench - Infiltration areas capture and temporarily store stormwater before allowing it to enter the soil. By slowing the release of water, pollutants are removed by underlying processes.In-Line Storage and Underground Detention - An underground detention system consists a series of special storage chambers to temporarily hold stormwater. In-line storage may use similar chambers or larger-than-necessary pipes to temporarily store stormwater as part of the pipe network.Oil-Water Separator - A device used to separate oil and other suspended solids from wastewater.Permeable/Porous Pavement - Any pavement that allows stormwater runoff to filter through the surface into an underlying storage or infiltration area. These areas typically also utilize underdrains.Retention Pond (Wet) - A retention pond or wet detention pond is a depression with a permanent pool that can store additional runoff during stormwater events.Sand/Organic Filter or Vegetated Filter Strip - Any area that uses sand, vegetation, or other organic material to catch large particle pollutants before they enter waterways. Stormwater Wetland - A stormwater wetland uses a combination of pools and complex native vegetation to store surface water runoff in a manner that mimics natural processes.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.",Feature Layer,"May 5, 2019",223,"['DemographicsOpendata', '2010 Census Tracts', 'Census Tracts']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/wcgis::2010-census-tracts-2,2019-05-05

The 2010 Census block group boundaries are used for Census Bureau statistical data tabulation purposes, including the 2010 Decennial Census and American Community Surveys. Census block groups are part of the sub-county census geography hierarchy of tracts, block groups, and blocks. The three census geographies nest to each other, forming a hierarchy of census tract, followed by block groups, and then blocks, with blocks being the smallest. A census block group is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block numbers within a census tract.

Users should be aware that the Census's Tiger line data is devised from a mix of national and local GIS data sets. When the Tiger line data is overlaid with Loudoun County Government's detailed GIS layers it can be determined that the Census Bureau's Tiger line boundaries in some cases are slightly off from the actual location of the physical features, natural features, and governmental units such as town boundaries that they are designated to follow.

1065,Williamson Act Contracts,"Mono County & the Town of Mammoth Lakes, CA | MonoCountyCA","This dataset is a selection of the Tax Parcels dataset that depicts parcels that are protected under the Williamson Act. The California Land Conservation Act (Williamson Act) was enacted by the State Legislature in 1965 as a means of preserving California's Prime agricultural lands from urbanization. Since it was enacted, the Act has been amended several times to allow its use not only to protect prime agricultural lands, but most other types of open space lands as well.The Williamson Act involves voluntary contracts between landowners and a city or county in which they agree to retain their lands in agriculture or other open space uses for a minimum of ten years. In return for entering into this contract, the landowners receive property tax relief on the lands under contract. This relief is provided through the assessment of the lands based upon their income-producing value rather than their market value, which may be considerably higher. The contracts have a ten-year term which are automatically renewed each year on a common anniversary date of January 1 unless they are cancelled or notice of non-renewal is given. If notice of non-renewal is given by either party to a contract, the non-renewal process begins on the following anniversary with nine years remaining. During the remaining term of the contract after notice of non-renewal has been given, the property taxes increase gradually according to a formula that eventually brings them up to the same level as non-Williamson Act lands",Feature Layer,"March 6, 2019",58,"['Williamson', 'Act', 'Contracts', 'Planning', 'Agriculture', 'Mono', 'County', 'California', 'GIS', 'Data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/MonoMammoth::williamson-act-contracts,2019-03-06

Loudoun County’s rail service districts were established on December 5, 2012 to fund the construction and maintenance of the stations, rail line, and rail related facilities and services. All parcels in the districts, residential and commercial, have a special property tax rate for funding of the rail. Tax collection for the districts is for Tax Year 2013 and future years.The boundaries of the Metrorail Service District were defined using physical features such as major roads and streams within two miles of stations. In some cases, parcel boundaries were used to develop the tax district boundary. The Route 606/Airport and Route 772 station service districts were defined using half-mile radii around the four proposed rail stations in or near Loudoun County: 1) Route 772, 2) Route 606, 3) Dulles Airport, and 4) Route 28. These radii were used as approximate guidelines. At the time the districts were established, the districts encompassed primarily commercial land.

The data are used extensively for taxation, subdivision review, permitting, and planning. Supplemental Information: Boundaries generally follow parcel lines, although there are several exceptions. The zoning data does not include zoning overlay districts, such as LDN, Floodplain, Quarry, or Mountainside Overlay Districts. Although the layer represents the official zoning map, a determination should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify zoning for a particular property. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN. It is also important to note that in order to determine the Zoning Ordinance Amendments (ZOAMs) that are applicable to a particular parcel governed under the Revised 1993 Zoning Ordinance located within the Route 28 Tax District, the ZO_ZONE_DATE, Opt-In Letter, proffer statement, rezoning plat and/or concept development plan should be consulted as applicable. For an official determination regarding the applicable zoning, zoning ordinance text and/or whether proffered conditions may apply to a certain property, please contact the Zoning Administrator in the Department of Building and Development. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a feature class. The coordinate system is Virginia State Plane (North), Zone 4501, datum NAD83 HARN.

89,Loudoun Village Conservation Overlay District,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More MetadataThe Village Conservation Overlay District (VCOD) layer is a zoning overlay district of the Revised 1993 Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance (Zoning Ordinance) and identifies thirteen small villages and hamlets outside of the boundaries of Loudoun County’s incorporated towns and planned residential communities that contain unique, scenic and historic characteristics that should be maintained and protected. The VCOD is a component of the Official Zoning Ordinance adopted by the Board of Supervisors on January 6, 2003, effective on January 7, 2003, and the Zoning Ordinance further amended on December 6, 2006, and is shown on the Official Loudoun County, VA Zoning Map. The VCOD layer is owned and maintained by Loudoun County, Virginia Department of Building and Development.Purpose:The VCOD is established to recognize the development patterns existing in traditional villages, considered to be valuable heritage resources, and to encourage the retention and reinforcement of the pattern, character and visual identity of the individual village. The data are used extensively for taxation, subdivision review, permitting, and planning. Although the feature class represents the VCOD, a determination should be requested from the Zoning Administrator to verify whether a particular property is located within the VCOD.",Feature Layer,"July 18, 2018",13,"['open data', 'Loudoun County', 'VCOD', 'Village Conservation', 'overlay district']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/LoudounGIS::loudoun-village-conservation-overlay-district,2018-07-18
90,Loudoun Mountainside Overlay District 1993,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"MetadataThe Mountainside Development Overlay District is a zoning overlay district administered by the Department of Building and Development. Mountainside classifications are based upon the following criteria: critical elevation, debris flow (slippage) potential, groundwater recharge, soils, slope, and forest values. Critical elevation areas are determined from the County's digital topography, soil and slope values are based upon data, the County's soil layer, and forested areas are based upon the digital forest data. This original MDOD replaces the voided layer implemented in 2003 (see disclaimer above).Purpose:The Mountainside Development Overlay District is a zoning overlay district (see Section 4-1600 of the 1993 Loudoun County Zoning Ordinance) and regulates development on the mountainsides of the County. Mountainside data should be used for general planning purposes only and is not intended for use in delineating specific use or suitability of soils for a particular site. Areas prone to debris flow (slippage) may not be accurately delineated. The Department of Building and Development is responsible for final clearance and interpretation on zoning/building permits and land development applications for the Mountainside Development Overlay District.",Feature Layer,"July 18, 2018","11,078","['Loudoun County', 'planning', 'Mountainside', 'zoning', 'overlay district', 'open data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/LoudounGIS::loudoun-mountainside-overlay-district-1993,2018-07-18
91,Loudoun Soils,Loudoun GIS | LoudounCounty,"More MetadataAbstract:The general soil association map outlines broad areas which have distinctive patterns in landscape and general geographic appearance. Each of the soil associations has a unique set of features which effect general use and management including shape and length of slope; width of ridgetops and valleys; frequency, size, and direction of streams; type of vegetation, rate of growth; and agriculture. These differences are largely the result of broad differences in kinds of soils and in the geologic materials from which the soils formed. A mapping unit typically consists of one or more major soils with minor soils, and is named for the major soils. This map shows, in small scale, a summary of the information contained on the individual detailed soil maps for Loudoun County. Because of its small scale and general soil descriptions, it is not suitable for planning small areas or specific sites, but it does present a general picture of soils in the County, and can show large areas generally suited to a particular kind of agriculture or other special land use. For more detailed and specific soils information, please refer to the detailed soils maps and other information available from the County Soil Scientist. Digital data consists of mapping units of the various soil types found in Loudoun County, Virginia. The data were collected by digitizing manuscript maps derived from USDA soil maps and supplemented by both field work and geological data. Field work for the soil survey was first conducted between 1947 and 1952. Soils were originally shown at the scale of 1:15840 and then redrafted by the County soil scientist to 1:12000; the data were redrafted a final time to fit Loudoun County's base map standard of 1:2400. Although the current data rely heavily on the original soil survey, there have been extensive field checks and alterations to the soil map based on current soil concepts and land use. The data are updated as field site inspections or interpretation changes occur.Purpose:Digital data are used to identify the mapping unit potential for a variety of uses, such as agriculture drainfield suitability, construction concerns, or development possibility. This material is intended for planning purposes, as well as to alert the reader to the broad range of conditions, problems, and use potential for each mapping unit. The mapping unit potential use rating refers to the overall combination of soil properties and landscape conditions. The information in this data set will enable the user to determine the distribution and extent of various classes of soil and generally, the types of problems which may be anticipated. HOW NOT TO USE THIS INFORMATION The information in this guide is NOT intended for use in determining specific use or suitability of soils for a particular site. It is of utmost importance that the reader understand that the information is geared to mapping unit potential and not to specific site suitability. An intensive on-site evaluation should be made to verify the soils map and determine the soil/site suitability for the specific use of a parcel. The original Soil Survey was written for agricultural purposes, but the emphasis has shifted to include urban/suburban uses. The Revised Soil Survey is currently under technical review and is expected to be published by 2006.Supplemental information:The Interpretive Guide to the Use of Soils Maps; Loudoun County, VA, is available at the Public Information Counter for the Office of Mapping and Geographic Information. It contains more detailed soils information. Data are stored in the corporate ArcSDE Geodatabase as a polygon feature class.
