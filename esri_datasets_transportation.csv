208,Centerline Routes,Riverside County Mapping Portal | GISOpenData@rivco.org,"The CENTERLINE_ROUTES feature class contains linear referencing routes derived from the Centerlines feature class. These routes are Polyline M features. The M geometry values, also known as Measures, provide an alternative to X and Y coordinates for describing locations along a line. These measures can be used to define point or line events that align with a chosen Route. To use the CENERLINE_ROUTE features as the basis for events, an event table must contain fields that include the ROUTE_NAME value of each event and either one or two event measure positions to create a point or line event respectively.The fields of the CENTERLINE_ROUTES feature class are:ROUTE_NAME - The unique identifier of each Route. It is based on the Street Name of the Centerlines and the predominant General Plan Area Plan where the Route is located. Other components of the name may distringuish different route branches or separate route alignments of a Street Name within a given Area Plan. Route names may also indicate the route's direction of travel for freeways and other roads that are divided into two lines.ROUTE_DIRECTION - This field is a component of the Route Name and only has a value when the Route follows Centerlines with a single direction of travel. Its values are made up of EB, NB, SB, and WB for Eastbound, Northbound, Southbound, and Westbound, and a number to distinguish any separate branches.FULL_NAME - The Full Name of the Street derived from the Centerlines.AREA_PLAN_ABBREVIATION - A four to five letter abbreviation for the predominant General Plan Area Plan of the Route derived from the Centerline features. These values can be used to group routes by area and to make distinctions in street names that appear in more than one portion of the County. The abbreviations and their meanings are as follows: DESCN - Desert Center; ECDES - East County/Desert; ECVAP - Eastern Coachella Valley Area Plan; ELSIN - Elsinore Valley; EVALE - Eastvale; HIGHG - Highgrove; HVWIN - Harvest Valley/Winchester; JURUP - Jurupa Valley; LAKEV - Lakeview/Nuevo; LMATH - Lake Mathews/Woodcrest; MARCH - March; MEADV - Mead Valley; PASS - The Pass; PVERD - Palo Verde Valley; RECHE - Reche Canyon; REMAP - REMAP (Riverside Extended Mountain Area Plan); RIVER - Riverside/Corona/Norco; SANJA - San Jacinto Valley; SUNCI - Sun City/Menifee Valley; SWAP - Southwest Area Plan; TEMES - Temescal Canyon; WCVAP - Western Coachella Valley Area Plan.SUBROUTE - Used when Routes with the same Street Name and Area Plan branch or follow separate alignments that are unlikely to join together in the future.FROM_MEASURE - The measure of the beginning point of the Route. Normally this value is 1000.TO_MEASURE - The measure of the ending point of the Route. This measure will generally be length of the Route in feet plus 1000. The length of any gaps within the route are also included in the To measure.LENGTH - The actual length in feet of the Route excluding gaps and rounded to match the precision of the Route's measures.MEASURE_MONOTONICITY - A value indicating the simplicity or complexity of the Route based on its measure pattern. A value of 1 indicates that the Route is simple, with continuously increasing measures only. All other values indicate that a Route is complex, and includes other patterns of increasing, decreasing, stagnant, or unassigned measures.PARTS - The number of polyline parts within the Route. Any value higher than 1 indicates that the Route contains one or more gaps or branches.CREATED_DATE - The date the Route was created as a linear reference feature.MODIFIED_DATE - The last date the Route was modified, if any.LINE_LINK - This field contains a reprentation of the Route's geometry and is made up of 5 components within curly brackets - The From X coordinate, the From Y coordinate, the To X coordinate, the To Y coordinate, and the Length. This field is used to detect changes in geometry when the script is run to update the routes.",Feature Layer,"August 16, 2020","40,477","['centerline routes', 'centerline', 'transportation']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CountyofRiverside::centerline-routes,2020-08-16

This means the RID of a trail segment can change over time, for example when a new alignment occurs. Each trail segment has a unique ID, within the ""SegmentID"" field, that never changes over time.All trails are routes and have directionality and measures associated with them. The measures are based on the field measured trail length. Field measured trail length is stored in the ""MeasuredFeet"" field and GIS trail length is stored in the ""shape.length"" field.

578,Posted Seasonal Load Restrictions Public View,Authoritative_mto_on_ca,"Seasonal Loads & Winter Weight PremiumsUnder Section 122(5) of the Highway Traffic Act, the province enforces reduced load restrictions on trucks to protect Ontario’s highways during spring thaw, when road damage is most likely to occur.During a reduced load period signs are posted on restricted highways, limiting axle weight for commercial motor vehicles and/or trailers to 5,000 kilograms. Signs are posted five days in advance of the start of a restriction period.Restriction periods are divided into three categories (Schedules), with start/end dates varying between March 1st and June 30th. Actual restriction dates imposed vary by highway, and are dependent on individual road freeze/thaw conditions, which are evaluated regionally.Enforcing load restrictions during the spring thaw period is a cost effective method of maximizing pavement service life while mitigating the economic impacts to the transportation industry, particularly those involved in the transportation of raw forest products.Restrictions must be posted five days in advance of their effect, which requires a conservative assessment that may restrict commercial traffic more than is necessary according to the physical conditions of the roadway.During the winter months, the strength of the pavement structure increases, as does its carrying capacity, as a result of frost development. Commercial vehicles using these roads are permitted to increase their payloads by 10%, as a Winter Weight Premium (Raw Forest Product Allowance).It is important that the ministry maintain a balance between protecting its road system while minimizing impacts to industry, by setting and lifting these restrictions as accurately as possible.Highways on this layer will be colour-coded based on current restriction status found in the Status_Colour field:0 = No Restrictions1 = 5 Day Warning Period2 = Restrictions in Place3 = Raw Forest Product Allowance in PlaceRestrictions are imposed in 5 separate geographical areas, as per the Highway Traffic Area, and are essentially divided as follows:Zone 1A – Northwestern Region (northern portion)Zone 1B – Northwestern Region (southern portion)Zone 2A – Northeast Region (northern portion)Zone 2B – Northeast Region (southern portion)Zone 3 – Northeast Region (Huntsville area)",Feature Layer,"June 1, 2020",141,"['SLR - 5 Day Warning', 'Roads', 'Seasonal', 'Restrictions', 'Highways', 'Winter Weight Premiums', 'ArcGIS', 'Service Definition', '.sd', 'Ministry of Transportation Ontario', 'Open Data', 'Traveller Information', 'Ontario 511']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/a5c6e3674c604a19865d3eba0c2b9aee_0,2020-06-01

The Water Trail is a network of launch and destination, or landing, sites (“trailheads”) around the San Francisco Bay. The sites allow people in human-powered boats and beachable sail craft to take single-day and multiple-day trips on the Bay. For the Water Trail, human-powered boats and beachable sail craft means any type of paddle or rowing vessel (e.g., kayak, dragon boat, rowboat, scull, etc.) or sailboard (windsurfer or kiteboard). The terms human-powered boats and beachable sail craft are used interchangeably with non-motorized small boats in Water Trail documents. The Water Trail is unique among the trails found in the Bay Area. It is not a linear trail, but a network of launching and landing sites that can take you to iconic and incredible destinations on the San Francisco Bay and its major tributaries – the San Joaquin River, the Napa River, and the Petaluma River. Some locations offer nature and solitude with opportunities to see a huge variety of birds and wildlife, others offer dynamic urban waterfronts with incredible sights and views. Each trailhead enables non-motorized small boat users to enjoy the historic, scenic, cultural, and environmental richness of San Francisco Bay and its nearby tributary waters.  With over 500-square miles of navigable waters, the San Francisco Bay and its tributaries are the Bay Area’s largest open space.More information on the Water Trail program can be found at sfbaywatertrail.org. To find out more about the Water Trail’s history or to download documents, please visit the State Coastal Conservancy – Water Trail website.

759,1.22 PQI Road Segment (detail),City of Tempe | TempeData,"Tempe’s roadways are an important means of transportation for residents, the workforce, students, and visitors. Tempe measures the quality and condition of its roadways using a Pavement Quality Index (PQI). This measure, rated from a low of 0 to a high of 100, is used by the City to plan for maintenance and repairs, and to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.This measure is created using pavement quality data maintained in the RoadMatrix Pavement Management Program. About every three years, the City surveys pavement, such as the smoothness of roadways and any signs of distress in the pavement surface. This data is then used to calculate the PQI, which determines roadway maintenance prioritization schedules as well as the most optimal road treatment options (such as placing a filler material in the cracks and treating the entire pavement surface, milling and replacing the top layer of the asphalt pavement, reconstructing the street section)This page provides data for the performance measure related to PQI.  To access geospatial data regarding PQI please visit https://data.tempe.gov/dataset/pavement-quality-index-segmentsThe performance measure dashboard is available at 1.22 Pavement Quality IndexThis dataset provides PQI for inpidual road segments.The City of Tempe’s Asset Management Capital Maintenance Program oversees and distributes funds for the upkeep of infrastructure such as streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters. Roadway network conditions are evaluated by assigned a value using the Pavement Quality Index or PQI. Calculated on a scale ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), the PQI is an indication of the condition of the pavement structure.Additional InformationSource: Stantec/Road MatrixContact (author): Isaac ChaviraContact E-Mail (author): isaac_chavira@tempe.govContact (maintainer): Sue TaaffeContact E-Mail (maintainer): sue_taaffe@tempe.govData Source Type: CSVPreparation Method: Extracted from Roadmatrix and joined to GIS networkPublish Frequency: Annual (Average PQI)/Quarterly (Segment PQI)Publish Method: ManualData Dictionary",Table,"January 3, 2020","5,350","['Engineering and Transportation', 'Safe', 'Pavement Quality Index (PM 1.22)', 'transit', 'transportation']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tempegov::1-22-pqi-road-segment-detail,2020-01-03

779,San Francisco Bay Trail,Metropolitan Transportation Commission | orgData,"About the Bay Trail The San Francisco Bay Trail is a planned 500-mile walking and cycling path around the entire San Francisco Bay running through all nine Bay Area counties, 47 cities, and across the region’s seven toll bridges. With over 350 miles in place, the Bay Trail connects communities to parks, open spaces, schools, transit and to each other, and also provides a great alternative commute corridor. The ultimate goal of the Bay Trail is to build a beautiful shoreline bicycle and pedestrian path for all to enjoy.**The Open Data viewer is intended for general display of features and is not appropriate for feature exploration. Use the feature map viewer to explore trail feature attributes through symbology and filtering, or print a basic map.** Trail Types Because the trail circumnavigates the entire San Francisco Bay, a wide variety of landscapes and experiences can be found. For a bustling scene, walk or bike the Embarcadero in San Francisco on a sunny (or foggy) afternoon. For peace and solitude interrupted only by bird song and windswept grasses, make your way to the Tubbs Island Trail on the shores of San Pablo Bay in Sonoma County. Nearly 227 miles of the existing Bay Trail are paved, and 127 miles are natural surface trails of varying widths. In some locations, the Bay Trail consists of bike lanes and sidewalks. In addition to walkers and cyclists, the trail is used by joggers, skaters, birdwatchers, photographers, kite-flyers, wheelchair riders, picnickers, and more. History Senate Bill 100, authored by then-state Senator Bill Lockyer and passed into law in 1987, directed the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) to develop a plan for this regional trail system including a specific alignment for the Bay Trail. The Bay Trail Plan, adopted by ABAG in July 1989, includes a proposed alignment; a set of policies to guide the future selection, design and construction of routes; and strategies for implementation and financing. Since its inception, the Bay Trail Plan has enjoyed widespread support in the Bay Area.",Feature Layer,"December 15, 2019",740,"['transportation', 'planning', 'mtc', 'metropolitan transportation commission', 'abag', 'association of bay area governments', 'trail', 'bay trail']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/MTC::san-francisco-bay-trail,2019-12-15

But a Multimodal District addresses more than just transportation - by adopting such a district, the community recognizes that mixed uses and well-designed buildings & public places are just as important as providing transit, bike paths, and sidewalks.According to the Florida Department of Transportation, ""a multimodal transportation district is an area where primary priority is placed on assuring a safe, comfortable, and attractive pedestrian environment, with convenient interconnection to transit...Common elements include the presence of mixed-use activity centers, connectivity of streets and land uses, transit-friendly design features, and accessibility to alternative modes of transportation.""A Multimodal District is created through adoption of an amendment to the Comprehensive Plan, and allows mitigation fees from development to go toward transit, bicycle, and pedestrian projects rather than road widening. This is important in the core of Tallahassee because there isn't room to widen many roads, if any, without destroying parts of the community.MMTD Code - Implementing the Multimodal Transportation DistrictThe MMTD Code covers all areas within the MMTD, including our downtown. The code seeks to improve the urban fabric of the Capital City through an increased emphasis on urban design and the public realm, thereby creating a pedestrian-friendly and transit-supportive district. The standards will: improve urban design, as is expected along Gaines Street, increase bicycle and pedestrian mobility, improve pedestrian comfort with more street trees, promote in-town amenities and destinations, ease restrictions to urban infill, and support the efforts of StarMetro. The new development standards in the MMTD Code reflect public comments voiced in the past several years, namely in various sector and neighborhood plans, calling for increased attention to urban design and bicycle and pedestrian mobility.

888,Road Tunnels,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"This dataset is based on the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory (NBI).  Tunnels in the United States According to the HSIP Tiger Team Report, a tunnel is defined as a linear underground passageway open at both ends.  Records in the NBI that are attributed as ""Tunnels"" were extracted by TGS and were located using a combination of ortho imagery, topographic DRGs, NAVTEQ streets, and NAVTEQ railroads. Two points were captured for each tunnel, one at each tunnel opening. A line was then created either by tracing the NAVTEQ street / railroad, or, if there was not a NAVTEQ street / railroad coincident with the tunnel, then by a straight line joining the two points. For some tunnels, the NBI contains two records, one for the road through the tunnel and one for the road on top of the tunnel (if any). In these cases, both have been captured in this dataset. Features in this dataset that are over tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""1"", while features that are in tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""2"". Presumably, this was done because both roads could be blocked if the tunnel was destroyed. In some cases, the NBI only represented a tunnel with a record of type = ""1"" (over). In these cases, the following rules were applied: 1) If there was no road running through the tunnel, the road on top of the tunnel was captured. For example, if a mine conveyor runs through the tunnel and a county highway runs on top of the tunnel, the county highway was captured. 2) If a road ran through the tunnel, then this road was captured and the [RECTYPE] was changed to ""2"". The ""feature carried"" and ""feature intersected"" fields were also changed to be consistent with the feature actually captured.

The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency.

Pedestrians, skaters, wheelchair users, joggers, and other non-motorized users typically use shared-use paths.Class II: Bike Lane - Portion of the roadway that has been designated by striping, signing and pavement markings for the preferential or exclusive use of bicycles. Some cities and counties also define wide shoulders as bike lanes. Always ride about 4 feet from parked cars to avoid the door zone.Class III: On-Street Bike Route - Any road or street designated for bicycle travel.

The complete set of data can be found on the NH DOT GIS Data Catalog.IRI is used to define a characteristic of the longitudinal profile of a traveled wheeltrack and constitutes a standardized roughness measurement. Pavement roughness is generally defined as an expression of irregularities in the pavement surface that adversely affect the ride quality of a vehicle (and thus the user). Roughness is an important pavement characteristic because it affects not only ride quality but also vehicle delay costs, fuel consumption and maintenance costs.The average IRI (inches/mile) corresponds to a condition rating score.Good when less than 95 average IRIFair when 96 to 170 average IRIPoor when 171 to 350 average IRIVery Poor when greater than 350 average IRIRoads that are not rated primarily consist of ramps and unpaved roads.

Red list bridges are in poor condition or require a posted weight limit.  State owned red list bridges are inspected twice per year and municipally owned red list bridges are inspected once per year.The overall condition of a bridge is determined by the lowest condition rating of its major elements; deck, superstructure, and substructure [or culvert]. The condition of each element ranges from zero to nine, with zero indicating that the element is in failed condition and nine indicating that the element is in excellent condition.  Poor (or “red”) condition occurs when any element is rated less than or equal to 4.  Good (or “green”) condition requires all elements rated equal to or above 7.",Feature Layer,"May 11, 2018",549,"['UVLSRPC', 'Transportation', 'Bridge']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/851831e285d64bd1bda93ff69f26b5a0_0,2018-05-11

51,Railroad Bridges,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"Bridges-Rail in the United States According to The National Bridge Inspection Standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650.3), a bridge is: A structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads. Each bridge was captured as a point which was placed in the center of the ""main span"" (highest and longest span). For bridges that cross navigable waterways, this was typically the part of the bridge over the navigation channel. If no ""main span"" was discernable using the imagery sources available, or if multiple non contiguous main spans were discernable, the point was placed in the center of the overall structure. Bridges that are sourced from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) that cross state boundaries are an exception. Bridges that cross state boundaries are represented in the NBI by two records. The points for the two records have been located so as to be within the state indicated by the NBI's [STATE_CODE] attribute. In some cases, following these rules did not place the point at the location at which the bridge crosses what the user may judge as the most important feature intersected. For example, a given bridge may be many miles long, crossing nothing more than low lying ground for most of its length but crossing a major interstate at its far end. Due to the fact that bridges are often high narrow structures crossing depressions that may or may not be too narrow to be represented in the DEM used to orthorectify a given source of imagery, alignment with ortho imagery is highly variable. In particular, apparent bridge location in ortho imagery is highly dependent on collection angle. During verification, TechniGraphics used imagery from the following sources: NGA HSIP 133 City, State or Local; NAIP; DOQQ imagery. In cases where ""bridge sway"" or ""tall structure lean"" was evident, TGS attempted to compensate for these factors when capturing the bridge location. For instances in which the bridge was not visible in imagery, it was captured using topographic maps at the intersection of the water and rail line. TGS processed 784 entities previously with the HSIP Bridges-Roads (STRAHNET Option - HSIP 133 Cities and Gulf Coast). These entities were added into this dataset after processing. No entities were included in this dataset for American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands because there are no main line railways in these areas. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is given by the publication date which is 09/02/2009. A more precise measure of currentness cannot be provided since this is dependent on the NBI and the source of imagery used during processing.",Feature Layer,"April 30, 2018","86,894","['ESF1', 'Bridges.', 'Transportation.', 'HIFLD', 'CalOES Library', 'ESF1 Transportation', 'Data Library', 'Basedata', 'CalOES Data Library']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::railroad-bridges,2018-04-30
