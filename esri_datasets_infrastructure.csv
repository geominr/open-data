Transmission mains are large-diameter pipelines (24"" or larger) that carry large quantities of raw water long distances from their source to a water treatment plant, then to the distribution grid system. Transmission mains generally run in a rather straight line from point to point. Lateral lines are not attached to transmission mains. Distribution mains are average-diameter pipes (4""–20"") that transport potable water from transmission lines and redistribute it throughout an area.

Water System Valve,City of Prince George | CPGGIS,"SystemValveA system valve is a facility that is fitted to a pipeline or orifice in which the closure member is either rotated or moved transversely or longitudinally in the waterway so as to control or stop the flow. System valves are used to regulate pressure, isolate, throttle flow, revent backflow, and relieve pressure. System valve types include Gate, Plug, Ball, Cone, and Butterfly. These specific types may be classified as isolation valves. Isolation valves are designed to start and stop the flow of water within the distribution network (and isolate portions of the network for maintenance or repair). Isolation valves are the predominant type of SystemValve installed in a distribution network. They are commonly intended to be either fully open or fully closed. They are not intended to throttle flow by being partially open.A gate valve is an isolation valve (which is modeled here as a system valve) that is used to prevent water flow via a simple gate mechanism. Gate valves may be motorized (and remotely controlled), and they may also have small bypass valves. Gate valves are not installed in locations where they need to be frequently operated due to the time required to open and close them. A butterfly valve is similar to a gate valve but uses a disk that is rotated ninety degrees to control the flow of water. Butterfly valves operate easier underlarge pressures and volumes of water than standard gate valves, and are thus found on larger pipes. However, because the butterfly valve disk stays in the water path even when the valve is open, the valve creates a higher resistance to flow (i.e., pressure loss) than a gate valve.

Water Control Valve,City of Prince George | CPGGIS,"This layer contains all Water Control Valves. Control valves are a set of valves that operate in special ways. There are three fundamental types of control valves: backflow control, air control, and altitude. A backflow control valve is a control valve designed to prevent water from flowing in the reverse direction. Essentially, backflow control valves allow flow in only one direction—the normal flow dirrection. Backflow control valves are open in the direction of normal flow and closed with the reversal of flow. Backflow control valves are commonly found near pump stations and reservoirs. Air control valves are control valves that are used to either relieve the system of trapped air or vacuums that may develop. Finally, an altitude valve is a control valve that controls water flow into a tower when the water level drops below a threshold. Altitude valves automatically shut off water flow when the water level in an elevated tank (or tower) reaches a preset elevation. A pressure reducing valve is a system valve with a horizontal disk for automatically reducing water pressures to a preset value. A pressure relief valve is a system valve that opens automatically when water pressure reaches a preset limit to relieve stress on a pipeline. Pressure relief valves are used to protect against rapid increases in pressure (i.e., water hammer). A pressure sustaining valve is a system valve that automatically sustains water pressures at a preset value. A pressure sustaining valve is similar to a pressure reducing valve but governs the pressure on the upstream rather than the downstream flow.Types of control valves represented include AirGap, AirControl, AirRelease, Altitude, BackflowControl, Combination, AtmosphericVacuum, DoubleCheck, PressureVacuum, ReducedPressureBackflow, RPZ, SimpleCheck, Vacuum, VacuumBreaker, and VacuumRelease.",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020",254,"['Control', 'valve', 'water', 'infrastructure']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CityofPG::water-control-valve,Infrastructure,2020-09-10

There are numerous types of PressurizedMains in the water distribution model; they include AirRelease, BlowOff, Bypass, ChemicalInjection, DistributionMain, Interconnect, ipeBridge, SamplingStation, and TransmissionMain. Transmission mains are large-diameter pipelines (24"" or larger) that carry large quantities of raw water long distances from their source to a water treatment plant, then to the distribution grid system. Transmission mains generally run in a rather straight line from point to point. Lateral lines are not attached to transmission mains. Distribution mains are average-diameter pipes (4""–20"") that transport potable water from transmission lines and redistribute it throughout an area. Lateral lines attach directly to distribution mains.",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020",85,"['Pressurized main', 'Sanitary', 'Infrastructure', 'Utility']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CityofPG::sanitary-pressurized-main,Infrastructure,2020-09-10
Sanitary System Valve,City of Prince George | CPGGIS,"A system valve is a facility that is fitted to a pipeline or orifice in which the closure member is either rotated or moved transversely or longitudinally in the waterway so as to control or stop the flow. System valves are used to regulate pressure, isolate, throttle flow, revent backflow, and relieve pressure. System valve types include Gate, Plug, Ball, Cone, and Butterfly. These specific types may be classified as isolation valves. Isolation valves are designed to start and stop the flow of water within the distribution network (and isolate portions of the network for maintenance or repair). Isolation valves are the predominant type of SystemValve installed in a distribution network. They are commonly intended to be either fully open or fully closed. They are not intended to throttle flow by being partially open.A gate valve is an isolation valve (which is modeled here as a system valve) that is used to prevent water flow via a simple gate mechanism. Gate valves may be motorized (and remotely controlled), and they may also have small bypass valves. Gate valves are not installed in locations where they need to be frequently operated due to the time required to open and close them. A butterfly valve is similar to a gate valve but uses a disk that is rotated ninety degrees to control the flow of water. Butterfly valves operate easier underlarge pressures and volumes of water than standard gate valves, and are thus found on larger pipes. However, because the butterfly valve disk stays in the water path even when the valve is open, the valve creates a higher resistance to flow (i.e., pressure loss) than a gate valve. Additionally, if it becomes necessary to clean a main by using pigs or swabs, the butterfly valve would block the operation. Butterfly valves can be operated quickly, increasing the risk of serious water hammer.",Feature Layer,"September 10, 2020",16,"['System Valve', 'Sanitary', 'Infrastructure', 'Utility']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CityofPG::sanitary-system-valve,Infrastructure,2020-09-10

The UBIDs were coded using US DOE’s Implementation code. Please note that the current data set may include some unnecessary structures identified as buildings. These included sheds, overhangs, bus stops, and other structures that do not need to be assigned a UBID. An updated version of the UBID dataset will be released when this issue is resolved. This project is the result of the US DOE Better Buildings Building Energy Data Analysis (BEDA) Accelerator. US DOE is working with stakeholders including state and local governments, commercial and residential building data aggregators, property owners, and product and service providers to develop the UBID system and to pilot it in real-world settings. US DOE and its partners are demonstrating the benefits of UBID in managing and cross-referencing large building datasets and in reducing the costs and enhancing the value proposition of leveraging building energy data.

In March of 1996, Isaac Oshima and Paul Veisze used a SPOT Imagery confirmation process applied to those facilities for which Teale could not find an address match. The update occurred using SPOT View imagery sent to the various DFG facilities. The key personnel were requested to 'ink-in' the actual physical location(s) considered to be the HQ for that particular facility. The maps were then sent back and the correct point was represented in the GIS by a point. In 1999, under Paul Veisze, GIS staff were allocated the task of calling each facility within a region and checking whether the information on file was correct. The dataset was subsequently updated. Currently, the data is updated through receiving a database from FASB/Tami Garfio (""telephone and facility List"").

It is based on the Street Name of the Centerlines and the predominant General Plan Area Plan where the Route is located. Other components of the name may distringuish different route branches or separate route alignments of a Street Name within a given Area Plan. Route names may also indicate the route's direction of travel for freeways and other roads that are divided into two lines.ROUTE_DIRECTION - This field is a component of the Route Name and only has a value when the Route follows Centerlines with a single direction of travel. Its values are made up of EB, NB, SB, and WB for Eastbound, Northbound, Southbound, and Westbound, and a number to distinguish any separate branches.FULL_NAME - The Full Name of the Street derived from the Centerlines.AREA_PLAN_ABBREVIATION - A four to five letter abbreviation for the predominant General Plan Area Plan of the Route derived from the Centerline features. These values can be used to group routes by area and to make distinctions in street names that appear in more than one portion of the County. The abbreviations and their meanings are as follows: DESCN - Desert Center; ECDES - East County/Desert; ECVAP - Eastern Coachella Valley Area Plan; ELSIN - Elsinore Valley; EVALE - Eastvale; HIGHG - Highgrove; HVWIN - Harvest Valley/Winchester; JURUP - Jurupa Valley; LAKEV - Lakeview/Nuevo; LMATH - Lake Mathews/Woodcrest; MARCH - March; MEADV - Mead Valley; PASS - The Pass; PVERD - Palo Verde Valley; RECHE - Reche Canyon; REMAP - REMAP (Riverside Extended Mountain Area Plan); RIVER - Riverside/Corona/Norco; SANJA - San Jacinto Valley; SUNCI - Sun City/Menifee Valley; SWAP - Southwest Area Plan; TEMES - Temescal Canyon; WCVAP - Western Coachella Valley Area Plan.SUBROUTE - Used when Routes with the same Street Name and Area Plan branch or follow separate alignments that are unlikely to join together in the future.FROM_MEASURE - The measure of the beginning point of the Route. Normally this value is 1000.TO_MEASURE - The measure of the ending point of the Route. This measure will generally be length of the Route in feet plus 1000. The length of any gaps within the route are also included in the To measure.LENGTH - The actual length in feet of the Route excluding gaps and rounded to match the precision of the Route's measures.MEASURE_MONOTONICITY - A value indicating the simplicity or complexity of the Route based on its measure pattern. A value of 1 indicates that the Route is simple, with continuously increasing measures only. All other values indicate that a Route is complex, and includes other patterns of increasing, decreasing, stagnant, or unassigned measures.PARTS - The number of polyline parts within the Route. Any value higher than 1 indicates that the Route contains one or more gaps or branches.CREATED_DATE - The date the Route was created as a linear reference feature.MODIFIED_DATE - The last date the Route was modified, if any.LINE_LINK - This field contains a reprentation of the Route's geometry and is made up of 5 components within curly brackets - The From X coordinate, the From Y coordinate, the To X coordinate, the To Y coordinate, and the Length. This field is used to detect changes in geometry when the script is run to update the routes.",Feature Layer,"August 16, 2020","40,477","['centerline routes', 'centerline', 'transportation']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CountyofRiverside::centerline-routes,,2020-08-16

OSMP Trails,City of Boulder | BoulderCO,"These data represent OSMP's designated trails. All trails in this dataset are also managed by OSMP, even though some trails are owned by other agencies. In general, each trail has been broken up into segments, usually between junctions. The unique ID for each trail segment is within the ""RID"" field, which is unique over time. This means the RID of a trail segment can change over time, for example when a new alignment occurs. Each trail segment has a unique ID, within the ""SegmentID"" field, that never changes over time.All trails are routes and have directionality and measures associated with them. The measures are based on the field measured trail length. Field measured trail length is stored in the ""MeasuredFeet"" field and GIS trail length is stored in the ""shape.length"" field. Currently the ""Mileage"" field is based on GIS trail length and not the field measured length.

TBD is to be determined.From the VMP: ""Management area designations define a management emphasis for different areas within the Open Space and Mountain Parks land system, based on a primary open space purpose (e.g., provision of quality passive recreational opportunities, preservation of agriculture, and protection and restoration of natural systems). The management designation defines suitable visitor activities in each type of area and under what conditions those activities can occur. The management designation also defines the management strategies needed to enhance visitor experience and ensure compatability of visitor activities with resource protetion.

The trails range from short nature walks (0.4 to 3.5 miles), to canyon overlook trails that lead to high plateaus (1.0 to 8.0 miles). Adventure seekers will find strenuous trails such as the world-famous Zion Narrows and a collection of slot canyons that helped form Zion Canyon (2.4 to 14 miles). In 1909 the President of the United States, William Howard Taft, named the area a National Monument to protect the canyon, under the name of Mukuntuweap National Monument. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service changed the park’s name to Zion.

Capitol Reef National Park Trails,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This feature layer, utilizing data from the National Park Service (NPS), depicts the trails within the Capitol Reef National Park. In the Fruita area, there are fifteen day-hiking trails with trailheads located along Utah Highway 24 and the Scenic Drive. These trails offer the hiker a wide variety of options, from easy strolls along smooth paths over level ground to strenuous hikes involving steep climbs over uneven terrain near cliff edges. Round trip distances vary in length from less than 0.25 miles to 10 miles (0.8-16 km). All trails are well-marked with signs at the trailhead and at trail junctions and by cairns (stacks of rocks) along the way. Capitol Reef offers many marked hiking routes which lead into narrow, twisting gorges and slot canyons and to spectacular viewpoints high atop the Waterpocket Fold. Popular backcountry hikes in the southern section of the park include Upper and Lower Muley Twist Canyons and Halls Creek. Backcountry hiking opportunities also exist in the Cathedral Valley area and near Fruita.In 1937, President Roosevelt set aside 37,711 acres of the Capitol Reef area as a National Monument.Two bills were introduced into Congress in 1970 to determine if Capitol Reef should become a national park. The Department of the Interior officials recommended that 254,000 acres be set aside as a national park. They also recommended a ten-year grazing phase-out period, to protect and conserve the land. A year later, the legislation, An Act to Establish the Capitol Reef National Park in the State of Utah, became Public Law 92-207 when it was signed by President Nixon on December 18, 1971.Capitol Gorge TrailData currency: January 2016Data source: Capitol Reef National Park TrailsForFor more information: Capitol Reef National ParkFo For feedback please contact: ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of: Ken LundOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest youDepartment of the InteriorNational Park ServiceNational Park Service content and data  National Park Service Open Data ArcGIS Online for the National Park Service",Feature Layer,"May 6, 2020",40,['federal'],https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/fedmaps::capitol-reef-national-park-trails-2,,2020-05-06
Canyonlands National Park Trails,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This feature layer, utilizing data from the National Park Service (NPS), depicts the trails within the Canyonlands National Monument Park. Canyonlands National Park preserves 337,598 acres of colorful canyons, mesas, buttes, fins, arches, and spires in the heart of southeast Utah's high desert. Water and gravity have been the prime architects of this land, sculpting layers of rock into the rugged landscape you see today. Canyonlands preserves the natural beauty and human history throughout its four districts, which are divided by the Green and Colorado rivers. While the districts share a primitive desert atmosphere, each retains its own character and offers different opportunities for exploration and adventure. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Arches National Monument Superintendent Bates Wilson advocated the creation of a National Park in what is now Canyonlands. On September 12, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 88-590 establishing Canyonlands National Park. Canyonlands was expanded to its current size of 337,598 acres on November 12, 1971 when the Maze, the Land of Standing Rocks, as well as Davis and Lavender Canyons were added to the park (Public Law 92-154).

Bryce Canyon National Park Trails,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This feature layer, utilizing data from the National Park Service (NPS), depicts the trails within the Bryce Canyon National Monument Park. Bryce Canyon offers several day-hiking trails. The most popular hikes are combinations of two or more of these basic trails. The hiking trails are divided into three categories of difficulty: easy, moderate, and strenuous. The trails involve steep climbs out of the canyon, and park elevations reach over 9,000 feet (2774 meters). Some trails are also shared by horses/mules April to October. President Warren G. Harding proclaimed Bryce Canyon a national monument on June 8, 1923. On June 7, 1924, Congress passed a bill to establish Utah National Park, when all land within the national monument would become the property of the United States. The land was acquired and the name was restored to Bryce Canyon. On February 25, 1928, Bryce Canyon officially became a national park.Sheep Creek TrailData currency: January 2016Data source: Bryce Canyon National Monument TrailsForFor more information: Bryce Canyon National ParkFo For feedback please contact: ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of: Bernard Spragg.

Arches contains a variety of hiking trails, many of which are considered easy to moderate. Trails provide access to outstanding viewpoints and arches not visible from the road. In some cases, trails travel under arches, affording quite a unique perspective on the park's namesake features. On April 12, 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed presidential proclamation No. 1875 reserving 1,920 acres in the Windows and 2,600 acres in the Devils Garden for the purpose of establishing Arches National Monument. Since that time, the park's boundaries have been expanded several times. In 1971, Congress changed the status of Arches to National Park, recognizing over 10,000 years of human history that flourished in this now-famous landscape of rock.Arches National Monument TrailsData currency: January 2016Data source: Arches National Park TrailsForFor more information: Arches National ParkFo For feedback please contact: ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of: Ken LundOther Federal User Community federally focused content that may interest youDepartment of the InteriorNational Park ServiceNational Park Service content and data  National Park Service Open Data ArcGIS Online for the National Park Service",Feature Layer,"May 6, 2020",22,['federal'],https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/fedmaps::arches-national-monument-trails,,2020-05-06

Data fields for the wells are listed in the ""Attributes"" section of this document.This GIS data set was produced as a general reference for the Department of Natural Resources, the oil and gas industry, environmental and regulatory agencies, landowners, and the public. Errors in or omissions of oil and gas well locations are due to several factors, some of which are incorrect data submitted by surveyors and/or operators, incorrect data entry in the Office of Conservation, lack of ""as drilled"" locations when changes are made to ""permitted"" locations, or problems related to missing data necessary to qualify well location coordinates for GIS use. Before making decisions relating to oil and gas well exploration and production, users of this data are encouraged to review the entire hard copy well file for any given well at the Office of Conservation in Baton Rouge or one of the Office of Conservation District Offices.

The final project was completed in October 2010. The enterprise GIS system on CEC's critical infrastructure database was leaded by GIS Unit in November 2014 and was implemented in May 2016. The data was derived from CEC's Quarterly Fuel and Energy Report (QFER), Energy Facility Licensing (Siting), Wind Performance Reporting System (WPRS), and Renewable Energy Action Team (REAT). The sources for the power plant point digitizing are including sub-meter resolution of Digital Globe, Bing, Google, ESRI and NAIP aerial imageries, with scale at least 1:10,000. Occasionally, USGS Topographic map, Google Street View and Bing Bird's Eye are used to verify the precise location of a facility.Although a power plant may have multiple generators, or units, the power plant layer represents all units at a plant as one feature. Detailed attribute information associated with the power plant layer includes CEC Plant ID, Plant Label, Plant Capacity (MW), General Fuel, Plant Status, CEC Project Status, CEC Docket ID, REAT ID, Plant County, Plant State, Renewable Energy, Wind Resource Area, Local Reliability Area, Sub Area, Electric Service Area, Service Area Category, California Balancing Authorities, California Air District, California Air Basin, Quad Name, Senate District, Assembly District, Congressional District, Power Project Web Link, CEC Link, Aerial, QRERGEN Comment, WPRS Comment, Geoscience Comment, Carto Comment, QFERGEN Excel Link, WPRS Excel Link, Schedule 3 Excel Link, and CEC Data Source.

Because the research to create this dataset was primarily keyed off of the headquarters of cabinet level state government agencies, some state office buildings that don't house a headquarters for such an agency may have been excluded. Intentionally excluded from this dataset are government run institutions (e.g., schools, colleges, prisons, and libraries). Also excluded are state capitol buildings, as these entities are represented in other HSIP layers. State owned or leased buildings whose primary purpose is not to house state offices have also been intentionally excluded from this dataset. Examples of these include ""Salt Domes"", ""Park Shelters"", and ""Highway Garages"". All entities that have been verified to have no building name have had their [NAME] value set to ""NO NAME"". If the record in the original source data had no building name and TGS was unable to verify the building name, the [NAME] value was set to ""UNKNOWN"".

Solar Energy Areas,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This feature layer, utilizing data from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), depicts solar energy areas in the U.S. The BLM on October 12, 2012 implemented a comprehensive Solar Energy Program to administer the development of utility-scale solar energy resources on BLM-administered public lands in six southwestern states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. On July 2012, the final Solar Programmatic Executive Information System (EIS) was released. EIS gives a comprehensive analysis that identifies locations on BLM lands most suitable for solar energy development.  These areas are characterized by excellent solar resources, access to existing or planned transmission and relatively low conflict with biological, cultural and historic resources. The Solar Programmatic EIS establishes an initial set of 17 Solar Energy Zones, totaling about 285,000 acres of public lands, that will produce as much as 23,700 megawatts of solar energy, enough to power approximately 7 million American homes.

Designations for Public Works,Gisborne District Council | GisborneDistrictCouncil,"A designation is a form of ‘spot zoning’ over a site, area or route in a district plan. The ‘spot zoning’ authorises the requiring authority’s work and activity on the site, area or route without the need for land use consent from the relevant territorial authority (i.e. s9(3) of the RMA does not apply). A designation has a similar effect to a plan change establishing a permitted activity as it: identifies the land affected in the district plan enables a requiring authority to undertake the works within the designated area without the need for a land use consent sets the parameters under which the activity can occur. Designations are also similar to a comprehensive land-use resource consent as they enable a requiring authority to undertake the works within the designated area (subject to any conditions applied to it). A designation restricts anyone other than the requiring authority from carrying out work on the designated land that will prevent or hinder the project or work to which the designation relates, without first obtaining the requiring authority’s permission.

Sworn Law Enforcement Officer Locations,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"Feature layer showing the locations of Sworn Law Enforcement Officer Locations in California.This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police). In general, the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city, and other government authorities within each state are usually empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies. Generally, sworn Law Enforcement officers must report which agency they are employed by to the state. Although TGS's intention is to only include locations associated with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS deleted these locations as we became aware of them, but some may still exist in this dataset. Personal homes, administrative offices, and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some personal homes of constables are included due to the fact that many constables work out of their homes. This also applies to mounted police in New Mexico. TGS has made a concerted effort to include all local police; county sheriffs; state police and/or highway patrol; Bureau of Indian Affairs; Bureau of Land Management; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Park Police; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Park Service; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the United States and its territories. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. At the request of NGA, FBI entities are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included. The HSIP Freedom Law Enforcement dataset and the HSIP Freedom Correctional Institutions dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes. Please see the process description for the breakdown of how the records were merged. With the merge of the Law Enforcement and the Correctional Institutions datasets, the HSIP Themes and NAICS Codes & Descriptions were assigned based on the facility's main function which was determined by the entity's name, facility type, web research, and state supplied data. In instances where the entity's primary function is both law enforcement and corrections, the NAICS Codes and Descriptions are assigned based on the dataset in which the record is located (i.e., a facility that serves as both a Sheriff's Office and as a jail is designated as [NAICSDESCR]=""SHERIFFS' OFFICES (EXCEPT COURT FUNCTIONS ONLY)"" in the Law Enforcement layer and as [NAICSDESCR]=""JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF)"" in the Correctional Institutions layer). Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. ""#"" and ""*"" characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on the values in this field, the oldest record dates from 12/07/2004 and the newest record dates from 09/10/2009.Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.1. An assessment of whether or not the total police capability in a given area is adequate. 2. A list of resources to draw upon in surrounding areas when local resources have temporarily been overwhelmed by a disaster - route analysis can help to determine those entities who are able to respond the quickest. 3.

Drainage Districts,Gisborne District Council | GisborneDistrictCouncil,"Stormwater drainage districts for the Gisborne district. Council owns and maintains a network of pipes and drains that form various stormwater drainage systems throughout our district. There are also many kilometres of open drains, creeks and streams on private property that the landowner is responsible to maintain. The drains Council owns and maintains are referred to as public drains. Contact us if you want to know if the drain on your property or elsewhere is private or public. Council owns and maintains a public stormwater system to protect people and property from flooding. The urban stormwater system covers Gisborne city including Wainui and Okitu and the following rural residential areas: Hicks Bay, Manutuke, Matawai, Patutahi, Ruatoria, Tikitiki, Ta Araroa, Te Karaka, Tokomaru Bay, Tolaga Bay, Te Puia Springs, Whatatutu. In rural residential areas, the urban public stormwater system is mostly located between the 70km - 100km speed zone. The residential zone is also used to determine the urban/rural boundary. The 'primary' urban stormwater system consists of around 140km of pipes with manholes, sumps and inlet/outlet structures. Also drains, swales, sumps, channels and detention areas. The piped system is designed to cater for a 10-year storm event, or a 10% probability of this sized rain event occurring each year. The ‘secondary’ stormwater system comes into action during significant heavy rain events. It consists of stormwater flow paths through reserves, private properties and alongside roads. It's designed to cater for a 100-year storm event, or a 1% probability of this sized rain event occurring each year. Just over 22km of significant streams, creeks and drains in Gisborne city are maintained on a regular basis. Many other minor drains in Gisborne city and some townships are maintained on an ‘as required’ basis.",Feature Layer,"September 19, 2019",33,"['Drainage', 'Utilities', 'Gisborne', 'Stormwater']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::drainage-districts,,2019-09-19

Road Tunnels,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"This dataset is based on the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory (NBI).  Tunnels in the United States According to the HSIP Tiger Team Report, a tunnel is defined as a linear underground passageway open at both ends.  Records in the NBI that are attributed as ""Tunnels"" were extracted by TGS and were located using a combination of ortho imagery, topographic DRGs, NAVTEQ streets, and NAVTEQ railroads. Two points were captured for each tunnel, one at each tunnel opening. A line was then created either by tracing the NAVTEQ street / railroad, or, if there was not a NAVTEQ street / railroad coincident with the tunnel, then by a straight line joining the two points. For some tunnels, the NBI contains two records, one for the road through the tunnel and one for the road on top of the tunnel (if any). In these cases, both have been captured in this dataset. Features in this dataset that are over tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""1"", while features that are in tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of ""2"". Presumably, this was done because both roads could be blocked if the tunnel was destroyed. In some cases, the NBI only represented a tunnel with a record of type = ""1"" (over). In these cases, the following rules were applied: 1) If there was no road running through the tunnel, the road on top of the tunnel was captured. For example, if a mine conveyor runs through the tunnel and a county highway runs on top of the tunnel, the county highway was captured. 2) If a road ran through the tunnel, then this road was captured and the [RECTYPE] was changed to ""2"". The ""feature carried"" and ""feature intersected"" fields were also changed to be consistent with the feature actually captured. According to the U.S. DOT: ""Our reporting requirements do not extend to tunnels, therefore, any info we have should be considered incomplete.""",Feature Service,"September 13, 2019",,"['ESF1', 'Tunnels', 'Underwater tunnels', 'Railroad tunnels', 'Transportation Ground', 'HIFLD', 'CalOES Library', 'Road and Railroad Tunnels', 'ESF1 Transportation', 'Transportation', 'Data Library', 'Basedata', 'CalOES Data Library']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::road-tunnels,,2019-09-13

Schools 2019,Sacramento Area Council of Governments | SACOG_Admin,"Every year SACOG reviews public and private K-12 schools, documenting closures and openings using data from the California Department of Education (CDE), the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento, school and school district websites, and local news sources. Points indicating the location of schools are placed in the parcel on which the school is built.Multiple points on a parcel may represent several schools sharing a campus such as a traditional school beside alternative or charter schools, or even multiple charter schools on one campus. When a school closes and re-opens later under a different name or different type or subtype, a point is kept to represent the old school and a new point is added for the new entity.School year enrollment and employment information is also included, sourced primarily from CDE. Public schools are covered well in CDE's databases, but private schools are not necessarily covered as their participation is more of a voluntary nature. While many report their data to CDE, it is not always consistently done resulting in gaps in enrollment and/or employment data or questions as to whether the school is still in operation. Additionally, private schools with six or fewer students are not required to report at all. Homeschools may also be represented in the database but will have inconsistent data as student numbers fluctuate over and under the six-student mark.",Feature Layer,"September 11, 2019","1,213","['Schools', 'K-12', 'infrastructure', 'employment', 'enrollment', 'education']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/SACOG::schools-2019,,2019-09-11

Yavapai County GIS created the polygons based on the 2011 and 2014 orthophotos to create a perimeter outline as it appears in aerial imagery. Elevated objects such as roof outlines in aerial imagery may appear displaced with respect to the base of the structure. The orthophotos are spatial referenced by the data collector therefore orthophotos could be off much as +/- 12 feet.  Elevated features like tops of buildings are not rectified to their true horizontal position. This offset of the tops of buildings appears as building lean.

SHSP (Strategic Highway Safety Plan) Data view,Iowa Department of Transportation | IowaDOT_PPM,"An SHSP (Strategic Highway Safety Plan) is a statewide-coordinated safety plan that provides a comprehensive framework for reducing highway fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads. The SHSP strategically establishes statewide goals, objectives and key emphasis areas developed in consultation with federal, state, local and private sector safety stakeholders. The SHSP plan process is a requirement of the Federal Highway Administration's Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP). In general, the federal HSIP requires that state transportation departments develop an SHSP that: includes consultation from a variety of stakeholders during the development process, analyzes and makes effective use of crash data, addresses the 5Es (engineering, enforcement, education, emergency services and everyone) plus management and operations, considers the safety needs of all public roads, describes a program of projects or strategies to reduce or eliminate safety hazards, is implemented and evaluated.Note: This data represents analysis conducted for the 2019-2023 SHSP only.

The REST Service includes aggregated data from the Medicare Fee-For-Service (Parts A&B) and Medicare Advantage (Part C) Programs for beneficiaries who rely on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment (DME) and cardiac implantable devices. Data includes the following DME and devices: cardiac devices (left, right, and bi-ventricular assistive devices (LVAD, RVAD, BIVAD) and total artificial hearts (TAH)), ventilators (invasive, non-invasive and oscillating vests), bi-level positive airway pressure device (BiPAP), oxygen concentrator, enteral feeding tube, intravenous (IV) infusion pump, suction pump, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at-home dialysis, motorized wheelchair or scooter, and electric bed. Purpose: Over 2.5 million Medicare beneficiaries rely on electricity-dependent medical equipment, such as ventilators, to live independently in their homes. Severe weather and other emergencies, especially those with long power outages, can be life-threatening for these individuals. The HHS emPOWER Map and public REST Service give every public health official, emergency manager, hospital, first responder, electric company, and community member the power to discover the electricity-dependent Medicare population in their state/territory, county, and ZIP Code. Data Source: The REST Service’s data is developed from Medicare Fee-For-Service (Part A & B) (>33M 65+, blind, ESRD [dialysis], dual-eligible, disabled [adults and children]) and Medicare Advantage (Part C) (>21M 65+, blind, ESRD [dialysis], dual-eligible, disabled [adults and children]) beneficiary administrative claims data. This data does not include individuals that are only enrolled in a State Medicaid Program. Note that Medicare DME are subject to insurance claim reimbursement caps (e.g. rental caps) that differ by type, so the DME may have different “look-back” periods (e.g. ventilators are 13 months and oxygen concentrators are 36 months). ZIP Code Aggregation: Some ZIP Codes do not have specific geospatial boundary data (e.g., P.O. Box ZIP Codes). To capture the complete population data, the HHS emPOWER Program identified the larger boundary ZIP Code (Parent) within which the non-boundary ZIP Code (Child) resides. The totals are added together and displayed under the parent ZIP Code. Approved Data Uses: The public HHS emPOWER REST Service is approved for use by all partners and is intended to be used to help inform and support emergency preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation activities in all communities. Privacy Protections: Protecting the privacy of Medicare beneficiaries is an essential priority for the HHS emPOWER Program. Therefore, all personally identifiable information are removed from the data and numerous de-identification methods are applied to significantly minimize, if not completely mitigate, any potential for deduction of small cells or re-identification risk.

Walkability Index,"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Sustainable Communities | data_GNRC","The Walkabiliy Index dataset characterizes every Census 2010 block group in the U.S. based on its relative walkability. Walkability depends upon characteristics of the built environment that influence the likelihood of walking being used as a mode of travel. The Walkability Index is based on the EPA's previous data product, the Smart Location Database (SLD). Block group data from the SLD was the only input into the Walkability Index, and consisted of four variables from the SLD weighted in a formula to create the new Walkability Index. This dataset shares the SLD's block group boundary definitions from Census 2010. The methodology describing the process of creating the Walkability Index can be found in the documents located at https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/OP/WalkabilityIndex.zip.

Building 2014 Footprints,Yavapai County GIS | yavgis_developers,"These building footprints are outlines of physical structures in Yavapai County. The outlines were extracted from the Digital Globe imagery service, dates ranging from March 2014 to November 2014. The beginning base building layer was taken from the 2011 building footprint layer and added/modified from the 2011 buildings to create the 2014 buildings.  Yavapai County GIS created the polygons based on the 2011 orthophotos to create a perimeter outline as it appears in aerial imagery. Elevated objects such as roof outlines in aerial imagery may appear displaced with respect to the base of the structure. The orthophotos are spatial referenced by the data collector therefore orthophotos could be off much as +/- 12 feet.  Elevated features like tops of buildings are not rectified to their true horizontal position. This offset of the tops of buildings appears as building lean. While the intent of orthophotos is to look straight down, virtually all the displayed orthophoto locations are photographed at some angle. This data is not accurate to survey standards.

Railroad Bridges,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"Bridges-Rail in the United States According to The National Bridge Inspection Standards published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650.3), a bridge is: A structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads. Each bridge was captured as a point which was placed in the center of the ""main span"" (highest and longest span). For bridges that cross navigable waterways, this was typically the part of the bridge over the navigation channel. If no ""main span"" was discernable using the imagery sources available, or if multiple non contiguous main spans were discernable, the point was placed in the center of the overall structure. Bridges that are sourced from the National Bridge Inventory (NBI) that cross state boundaries are an exception. Bridges that cross state boundaries are represented in the NBI by two records. The points for the two records have been located so as to be within the state indicated by the NBI's [STATE_CODE] attribute. In some cases, following these rules did not place the point at the location at which the bridge crosses what the user may judge as the most important feature intersected. For example, a given bridge may be many miles long, crossing nothing more than low lying ground for most of its length but crossing a major interstate at its far end. Due to the fact that bridges are often high narrow structures crossing depressions that may or may not be too narrow to be represented in the DEM used to orthorectify a given source of imagery, alignment with ortho imagery is highly variable. In particular, apparent bridge location in ortho imagery is highly dependent on collection angle. During verification, TechniGraphics used imagery from the following sources: NGA HSIP 133 City, State or Local; NAIP; DOQQ imagery. In cases where ""bridge sway"" or ""tall structure lean"" was evident, TGS attempted to compensate for these factors when capturing the bridge location. For instances in which the bridge was not visible in imagery, it was captured using topographic maps at the intersection of the water and rail line. TGS processed 784 entities previously with the HSIP Bridges-Roads (STRAHNET Option - HSIP 133 Cities and Gulf Coast). These entities were added into this dataset after processing. No entities were included in this dataset for American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands because there are no main line railways in these areas. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is given by the publication date which is 09/02/2009. A more precise measure of currentness cannot be provided since this is dependent on the NBI and the source of imagery used during processing.",Feature Layer,"April 30, 2018","86,894","['ESF1', 'Bridges.', 'Transportation.', 'HIFLD', 'CalOES Library', 'ESF1 Transportation', 'Data Library', 'Basedata', 'CalOES Data Library']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::railroad-bridges,,2018-04-30

It should not include planned and suspended (non-operational) sites and mobile clinics. These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs).1. VA HOSPITAL: an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE: Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital.2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP): provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes.3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU): provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual.4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS:a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are: >(i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA. >(ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE: This includes donated space staffed by VA. >(iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier. >(iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating.b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic: outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital.c. Independent Outpatient Clinic: a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting.5. VET CENTER: Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA.6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC): a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC). The definition of VA medical center does not include the Vet Centers as an identifying service. This dataset is based upon GFI data received from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

Urgent Care Facilities,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"Urgent Care Facilities Urgent care is defined as the delivery of ambulatory medical care outside of a hospital emergency department on a walk-in basis without a scheduled appointment. (Source: Urgent Care Association of America) The Urgent Care dataset consists of any location that is capable of providing emergency medical care and must provide emergency medical treatment beyond what can normally be provided by an EMS unit, must be able to perform surgery, or must be able to provide recuperative care beyond what is normally provided by a doctor's office. In times of emergency, the facility must be able to accept patients from the general population or patients from a significant subset of the general population (e.g., children). Florida and Arizona license Urgent Care facilities within their state. However, the criteria for licensing and the criteria for inclusion in this dataset do not appear to be the same. For these two states, this dataset contains entities that fit TGS' criteria for an Urgent Care facility but may not be licensed as Urgent Care by the state. During processing, TGS found that this is a rapidly changing industry. Although TGS intended for all Urgent Care facilities to be included in this dataset, the newest facilities may not be included. Entities that are excluded from this dataset are administrative offices, physician offices, workman compensation facilities, free standing emergency rooms, and hospitals. Urgent Care facilities that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset. ID# 10194253 is a ""mobile"" urgent care center that provides urgent care to private residences. This entity is plotted at its administrative building. Records with ""-DOD"" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. This dataset does not contain any Urgent Care facilities in American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record is dated 11/22/2004 and the newest record is dated 07/17/2009.",Feature Layer,"April 11, 2018","4,810","['HIFLD', 'CalOES Library', 'Urgent Care Facilities', 'ESF8', 'ESF8 Public Health and Medical', 'Public Health and Medical', 'Medical', 'Public Health', 'Emergency Services', 'Data Library', 'Basedata', 'CalOES Data Library']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::urgent-care-facilities,,2018-04-11

PSAP 911 Service Area Boundaries,CA Governor's Office of Emergency Services | CA_Office_of_Emergency_Services_GIS,"911 Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service area boundaries in the United States According to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed to receive 9-1-1 calls. The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such a system from within a military base, it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems, or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise, military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases, areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPs are (i.e., load balancing), operational status (i.e., redundancy), or time of day / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a ""Y"" in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases, this was geospatial information; in other cases, it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g., city and county boundaries). In some cases, existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g., ""entire county north of Country Road 30""). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county plus the homes and businesses along a road which is partly in another county. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.Homeland Security Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements. 1) A disaster has struck, or is predicted for, a locality. The PSAP that may be affected must be identified and verified to be operational. 2) In the event that the local PSAP is inoperable, adjacent PSAP locations could be identified and utilized.",Feature Layer,"June 7, 2017","5,597","['Emergency Services', 'HIFLD', 'CalOES Library', 'PSAP 911 Service Area Boundaries', 'ESF2', 'ESF2 Communications', 'Communications', 'PSAP', 'ESF5', 'ESF5 Management', 'Management', 'ESF13', 'ESF13 Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement', 'Emergency Management', 'Authoritative Data Source', 'Data Library', 'Basedata', 'CalOES Data Library']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::psap-911-service-area-boundaries,,2017-06-07
