Private households living in band housing, located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household, and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded. The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2016, while household total income is reported for the year 2015.

Private households living in band housing, located on an agricultural operation that is operated by a member of the household, and households who reported a zero or negative total household income are excluded. The relatively high shelter-costs-to-household income ratios for some households may have resulted from the difference in the reference period for shelter costs and household total income data. The reference period for shelter cost data is 2016, while household total income is reported for the year 2015. As well, for some households, the 2015 household total income may represent income for only part of a year. For additional information refer to the 2016 Census Dictionary for 'Total income' and 'Shelter cost'.

Tax Exempt,"Grant County, Washington | Admin_GrantCoWA","This service contains several themes related to visualization of Grant County land parcels. Parcels - this layer shows the outer boundary of the land parcel. Be aware that the polygons representing land parcels are based on survey data, but do not always exactly represent the survey data. This data is only a representation of the location and size of land parcels. You are invited to submit corrections to the Data Steward. Polygons are edited continuously as land is subdivided and segregated. Updates are usually posted bi-monthly. Parcels - Market Values - this layer categorizes parcels into $100,000 bands using the Assessor's Office market value calculations. Parcels - Vacant or undeveloped - this layer filters parcels that are not tax-exempt, and have a market crop value of $0 and a market building value of $0 to identify parcels that may be vacant or undeveloped. The results are symbolized by the Department of Revenue reporting code.  Parcels - Tax District - this layer symbolizes parcels by the tax district assigned to the each parcel. Parcels - Tax Exempt - this layer filters parcels that are coded as property tax exempt per the property tax exemption for nonprofit organizations. Qualifying organizations conducting an activity specifically identified in Chapter 84.36 of the Revised Code of Washington. Not all nonprofits have a purpose and activity that entitles them to an exemption. The use of the property determines the exemption. Typical organizations receiving property tax exemption are schools, churches, cemeteries, hospitals, social service agencies, character building organizations, nursing homes, homes for the aging, museums, performing arts facilities, and public meeting halls. The qualifying organizations receive abatement (exemption) of their property taxes. Special assessments are not eligible for this exemption. Please note: Property tax exemptions are only applicable to real and personal property located in Washington State. Nonprofit organizations, even though they may be exempt from federal taxes, are not generally exempt from taxes in Washington. Typically, organizations must own and exclusively use their property to conduct an activity specifically exempted by the Legislature to qualify for the exemption. Please note: Grant County does not track government department or agency ownership on a consistent basis. There are occasionally errors in the coding, please cross-check the tax records for the parcel of interest. You may also consult the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ""non-DNR Major Public Lands"" data as further reference for locations of public land.

2016 population ecumene by census division,cgp_aafc,"A population ecumene is the area of inhabited lands or settled areas generally delimited by a minimum population density. This ecumene shows the areas of the densest and most extended population within census divisions. Census divisions are the provincially legislated areas (such as county, municipalité régionale de comté, and regional district) or their equivalents. Census divisions are intermediate geographic areas between the province or territory level and the municipality (census subdivision). For further information, consult the Statistics Canada's 2016 Illustrated Glossary (see below under Data Resources). The assemblage of dissemination area population density data from the 2016 Census of Population are used to form the ecumene within census divisions. Areas included in the ecumene are dissemination areas where the population density is greater than or equal to 0.4 persons per square kilometre or about one person per square mile. In some areas to capture more population within the ecumene the criteria was extended to 0.2 persons per square kilometre. The ecumene areas were generalized in certain areas to enhance the size of some isolated ecumene areas in northern Canada. This map can be used as an ""ecumene"" overlay to differentiate the sparsely populated areas from the ecumene in conjunction with census division data or other small-scale maps.

This ecumene shows the areas of the densest and most extended population within census subdivisions. A census subdivision (CSD) is the general term for municipalities (as determined by provincial or territorial legislation) or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes (e.g., Indigenous Peoples reserves and communities and unorganized territories). Municipal status is defined by laws in effect in each province and territory in Canada. For further information, consult the Statistics Canada's 2016 Illustrated Glossary (see below under Data Resources).

Census division 2016,cgp_aafc,"Group of neighbouring municipalities joined together for the purposes of regional planning and managing common services (such as police or ambulance services). These groupings are established under laws in effect in certain provinces of Canada. Census division (CD) is the general term for provincially legislated areas (such as county, municipalité régionale de comté and regional district) or their equivalents. In other provinces and the territories where laws do not provide for such areas, Statistics Canada defines equivalent areas for statistical reporting purposes in cooperation with these provinces and territories. Census divisions are intermediate geographic areas between the province/territory level and the municipality (census subdivision). Census divisions (CD) have been established in provincial law to facilitate regional planning, as well as the provision of services that can be more effectively delivered on a scale larger than a municipality. In Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, provincial or territorial law does not provide for these administrative geographic areas. Therefore, Statistics Canada, in cooperation with these provinces and territories, has created equivalent areas called CDs for the purpose of disseminating statistical data. In Yukon, the CD is equivalent to the entire territory. Next to provinces and territories, census divisions (CD) are the most stable administrative geographic areas, and are therefore often used in longitudinal analysis.

Bay Regions - NBEP 2017 (shapefile),NBEP | julia.bancroft,"Narragansett Bay, Little Narragansett Bay, and the Southwest Coastal Ponds are the three estuarine study areas under the purview of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program. This dataset represents all coastal waters and the coastline of Rhode Island and portions of coastline in neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts, divided into seven regions of NBEP’s study areas according to all available information and the most common delineations of NBEP’s study areas. It includes the estuaries, the salt ponds, and estuarine tributaries. Regions are made up of several bay segments, grouped primarily according to shellfish management approaches. The boundaries of NBEP estuarine waters correspond to delineations by researchers studying the Bay. The Estuary Program compiled all available information and used the most common delineations to define estuarine waters. The upper boundaries of the estuarine waters correspond to the limits of tidal waters defined by: (1) the presence of existing dams (as of 2016) and (2) the extent of estuarine waters as defined and delineated by the states to assess water quality and shellfishing areas. The outer boundary of Narragansett Bay spans Point Judith and Sakonnet Point. See below for a full listing of data sources. This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements,California Department of Fish and Wildlife | cdfwgis,"The CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements dataset is a subset of the CDFW Lands dataset. It contains lands owned (fee title), some operated (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies that may be publicly accessible) and conservation easements held by CDFW. CDFW Owned and Operated Lands and Conservation Easements replaces the prior dataset, DFG Owned and Operated Lands, which included only fee title lands and some operated lands (wildlife areas, ecological reserves, and public/fishing access properties that are leases/agreements with other agencies and that may be publicly accessible). This is a generalized version dataset that has a shorter attribute table than the original and also has been dissolved based on the fields included. Please note that some lands may not be accessible due to the protection of resources and habitat. It is recommended that users contact the appropriate regional office for access information and consult regulations for CDFW lands in Sections 550, 550.1, 551, 552, 630 and 702. The CDFW Lands dataset is a digitized geographical inventory of selected lands owned and/or administered by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Properties such as ecological reserves, wildlife areas, undesignated lands containing biological resource values, public and fishing access lands, and CDFW fish hatcheries are among those lands included in this inventory. Types of properties owned or administered by CDFW which may not be included in this dataset are parcels less than 1 acre in size, such as fishing piers, fish spawning grounds, fish barriers, and other minor parcels. Physical boundaries of individual parcels are determined by the descriptions contained in legal documents and assessor parcel maps relating to that parcel. The approximate parcel boundaries are drawn onto U.S. Geological Survey 7.5'-series topographic maps, then digitized and attributed before being added to the dataset. In some cases, assessor parcel or best available datasets are used to digitize the boundary. Using parcel data to adjust the boundaries is a work in progress and will be incorporated in the future. Township, range, and section lines were based on the U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' series topographic maps (1:24,000 - scale). In some areas, the boundaries will not align with the Bureau of Land Management's Public Lands Survey System (PLSS).

It includes the estuaries, the salt ponds, and estuarine tributaries. Segments are the smallest divisions of the Bay used for analysis in the 2017 State of Narragansett Bay & Its Watershed Technical Report (nbep.org). The boundaries of NBEP estuarine waters correspond to delineations by researchers studying the Bay. The Estuary Program compiled all available information and used the most common delineations to define estuarine waters. The upper boundaries of the estuarine waters correspond to the limits of tidal waters defined by: (1) the presence of existing dams (as of 2016) and (2) the extent of estuarine waters as defined and delineated by the states to assess water quality and shellfishing areas. The outer boundary of Narragansett Bay spans Point Judith and Sakonnet Point. See below for a full listing of data sources.

River basins were not derived from the U.S. Geological Survey hierarchical system of hydrologic units, but WPA groupings were informed by MassGIS Major Watersheds (2000) and USGS HUC10 boundaries (2015). The Little Narragansett Bay and the Southwest Coastal Ponds drainage areas were not segmented further into river basins (for more information about the boundary of the Little Narragansett Bay watershed, see STUDYAREAS_NBEP2017). River basin coastlines were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019). This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

WAPSP EstuaryFunction2010,Washington State Puget Sound Partnership | Mary_Ramirez_wa_psp,"The Estuaries Common Indicator is a measure of functional estuary surface area, relative to the full potential estuary in Puget Sound’s 16 large river deltas: Elwha, Dungeness, Quilcene, Dosewallips, Duckabush, Hamma Hamma, Skokomish, Deschutes, Nisqually, Puyallup, Duwamish, Snohomish, Stillaguamish, Skagit, Samish, and Nooksack. The functional estuary surface area is composed of two distinct types of non-overlapping geospatial information: 1) Extent of functional tidal channels with full, natural tidal access, and 2) Extent of connected tidal wetlands with full exchange of natural tidal flows. Our ability to assess the Estuary Common Indicator necessitates an accurate and consistent approximation of tidal inundation across the 16 large rivers deltas. Two data sources were used to set this boundary. The Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership’s (PMEP) mapping of West Coast USA Current and Historical Estuary Extent (http://www.pacificfishhabitat.org/data/estuary-extents) combines NOAA’s extreme water level models and high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation models to approximate the maximum extent of tidal influence in Puget Sound estuaries. The PMEP tidal inundation dataset uses the 50 percent annual exceedance probability contour (the maximum inundation extent expected roughly every two years) to define the upper, landward extent of tidal influence. This extent covers areas with full tidal connection, including the freshwater tidal zone to head of tide, as well as areas of the estuary that are below the 50% exceedance elevation but which no longer have full tidal exchange due to human alterations to the landscape, such as dikes and tide gates. The lower, seaward extent of the estuary was delineated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center as part of the Puget Sound Salmon Habitat Status and Trends Monitoring Program (Beechie et al. 2017). The seaward extent of the estuary is set at the vegetated marsh boundary and geomorphic river mouth identified from aerial imagery. PSNERP wetland mapping in the large river deltas often included extensive intertidal areas, assigned to the euryhaline unvegetated (mud and sand flat) class, that extend into Puget Sound beyond the delta mouth. These outer intertidal areas are not included in the estuary extent delineated by NOAA which terminates at the vegetated wetland edge at the estuary mouth, unless the unvegetated area is associated with a restoration project that breached a dike that was the seaward edge of the delta prior to restoration (e.g. in the Nisqually and Stillaguamish).Together, the PMEP landward extent and the NOAA seaward extent represent the full area of inundation based on current topography, which is in effect, the full estuary extent.Channel features delineated by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center as part of the Puget Sound Salmon Habitat Status and Trends Monitoring Program (Beechie et al. 2017) represent the extent of distributary and tidal channels within the Common Indicator’s functional estuary surface area. NOAA digitized channels with full tidal connection from 2010 and 2011 1-meter resolution NAIP imagery as polygons to bankfull width as represented by the vegetated edge of the channel.",Feature Layer,"August 11, 2020","5,012","['Puget Sound Partnership (PSP)', 'Puget Sound (PS)', 'Washington (WA)', 'Delta', 'Common Indicator', 'Estuary', 'Estuary (Estuaries)']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/wa-psp::wapsp-estuaryfunction2010,2020-08-11

These maps, showing ownership and acreage, are the 'official record' of the acreage of Federal and non-federal lands within the park boundaries. While these maps are the official record of the lands and acreage within the unit's authorized boundaries, they are not of survey quality and not intended to be used for survey purposes.""

City Annexations Feature Layer,County of Los Angeles | NDAO@dpw.lacounty.gov_lacounty,"This layer contains information for locating past and present legal city boundaries within Los Angeles County. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works provides the most current shapefiles representing city annexations and city boundaries on the Los Angeles County GIS Data Portal.  True, legal boundaries are only determined on the ground by surveyors licensed in the State of California. Numerous records are freely available at the Land Records Information website, hosted by the Department of Public Works.Principal Attributes:NO: The row number in the attribute table of the PDF Annexation Maps. (See Below) ANNEX_No: These values are only used for the City of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  NAME: The official annexation name. TYPE: Indicates the legal action. A - represents an Annexation to that city. D - represents a Detachment from that city. V - is used to indicate the annexation was void or withdrawn before an effective date could be declared. 33 - Some older city annexation maps indicate a city boundary declared 'as of February 8, 1933'. ANNEX_AREA: is the land area annexed or detached, in square miles, per the recorded legal description. TOTAL_AREA: is the cumulative total land area for each city, arranged chronologically. SHADE: is used by some of our cartographers to store the color used on printed maps. INDEXNO: is a matching field used for retrieving documents from our department's document management system. STATE (Secretary of State): Date filed with the Secretary of State.  These are not available for earlier annexations and are Null. COUNTY (County Recorder): Date filed with the County Recorder.  These are not available for earlier annexations and are Null. EFFECTIVE (Effective Date): The effective date of the annexation or detachment. CITY: The city to which the annexation or detachment took place. URL: This text field contains hyperlinks for viewing city annexation documents. See the ArcGIS Help for using the Hyperlink Tool. FEAT_TYPE: contains the type of feature each polygon represents: Land - Use this value for your definition query if you want to see only land features on your map. Pier - This value is used for polygons representing piers along the coastline. One example is the Santa Monica Pier. Breakwater - This value is used for polygons representing man-made barriers that protect the harbors. Water - This value is used for polygons representing navigable waters inside the harbors and marinas. 3NM Buffer - Per the Submerged Lands Act, the seaward boundaries of coastal cities and unincorporated county areas are three nautical miles from the coastline.

The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a recut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible a decade ago. Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the latest land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase as a Geometric Network. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network.

Administrative Large Parcels Py,Alaska Department of Natural Resources ArcGIS Online | irm_admin,"This data contains the administrative large parcel boundaries for both the state and federal government. It combines the formerly known Legislatively Designated Areas (LDA's), or state parcels, and the Conservation System Units (CSU's), or federal parcels, with data improvements. The CSU's also contained additional federal management units, such as National Forests; hence, the name change. Data improvements are significant compared to previous versions of the LDA's and CSU's. The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) was used for all of the state parcels and several of the federal parcels. The previous LDA's coverage (prior to 2000), was automated at a section level. This dataset delineates the boundaries based on the exact legal description. Special notes about LDA's - The legislature may designate an area for special uses. Areas designated by the legislature may include refuges, sanctuaries, critical habitat areas, ranges, special management areas, forests, parks, recreation areas, preserves, public use areas, recreation rivers, and recreational mining areas. Consult the referenced Alaska Statutes to determine the legal description and special management intent of any particular area. Many areas also have regulations and plans that govern uses within their boundaries. State Wildlife Areas - Includes Sanctuaries, State Range Areas, Critical Habitat Areas and Refuges. They are established under Title 16, Chapter 20 of the Alaska Statutes to protect and preserve the natural habitat and game population or to enhance habitat for particular wildlife species. Most of these areas are managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. State Park Areas - Includes parks, marine parks, recreation areas, state preserves, and special management areas. They are established under Title 41, Chapter 21 of the Alaska Statutes to foster the growth and development of a system of parks and recreational facilities and opportunities in the state, for the general health, welfare, education, and enjoyment of its citizens and for the attraction of visitors to the state. Most of these areas are managed by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks and Outdoor Recreation. State Forest Areas - Includes state forests and resource management areas. They are established under Title 41, Chapter 15 or Chapter 17 of the Alaska Statutes primarily for management of forest resources. These areas are managed by the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry. Other State Multiple Use Areas - Includes public use areas, recreation rivers, and recreational mining areas. They are established under Title 41, Chapter 23 of the Alaska Statutes for special multiple use management of state public land and water resources by the Department of Natural Resources and management of public wildlife resources by the Department of Fish and Game.",Feature Layer,"June 19, 2020","11,620","['Alaska', 'Alaska DNR', 'Administrative', 'ADNR', 'ODP', 'Map Service', 'Offline']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/SOA-DNR::administrative-large-parcels-py,2020-06-19

This layer only includes information for Connecticut. Line features include State, county, and town (municipal) boundaries. Polygon features depict the geographic areas for individual towns (municipalities). A town may be represented by more than one polygon feature. For example, in addition to representing the portion of a town on the mainland, a polygon feature may also define an island along the coast of Long Island Sound. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 and latitude and longitude coordinates that define the boundary between the states of Connecticut and New York in Long Island Sound. Attribute information is comprised of codes to classify and cartographically symbolize political boundaries by type and identify the geographic areas encompassed by individual towns. Polygon feature attributes include state, county, and town codes and names. Feature length and geographic area are encoded for linear and polygon features, respectively.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.

River Environment Classification (REC2) New Zealand,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.5) - June 2019 [Hosted Feature Layer]This service depicts rivers as lines and catchments as polygons The River Environment Classification (REC) is a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers. The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a re-cut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible when it was originally created.Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network. REC2 can be downloaded or streamed and used directly in ArcMap. (A file geodatabase version for ArcGIS of REC2 can be downloaded as a zip file and used directly for analyses in ArcMap from here)This layer is using Esri's ArcGIS Online Optimizations for fast rendering.This is REC2 (Version 5) , June 2019 - a publicly available dataset from NIWA Taihoro Nukurangi.NIWA acknowledges funding from the MBIE SSIF towards the preparation of REC v2.5Coordinate Reference System: NZTM (New Zealand Transverse Mercator, EPSG: 2193)Geometric Representation of Rivers: LinesExtent (Bounding Box): Top(Latitude) -33.9534Bottom(Latitude) -47.4867 Left (Longitude) 166.2634 Right (Longitude) 178.9733 Riverlines table Attributes associated directly with network: Field Type Description Catarea Real Watershed area in m2 CUM_Area  Real Area upstream of a reach (and including this reach area) in m2.

Urban Growth Area,"Grant County, Washington | Admin_GrantCoWA","One of the first steps in the implementation of the Growth Management Act (GMA) is for counties and their cities to designate urban growth areas (UGAs), “within which urban growth shall be encouraged, and outside of which growth can occur only if it is not urban in nature.” RCW 36.70A.110 and WAC 365-195-335 provide clear criteria for designating urban growth boundaries around a city or a group of cities. Each urban growth area in a county should include enough land to accommodate the Washington State Office of Financial Management’s 20-year population projection allocated for thatUGA. The UGA should also include adequate land for industrial and commercial activities, open space, and other public facilities. A land capacity analysis should be conducted to determine if there is sufficient land included in the UGA for all these uses. A market factor can be built in to this analysis to compensate for the fact that only a portion of the land will be available for sale and development over the planning period. Within the UGA, a city and/or county is to designate sufficient open space, provide urban services, and permit development at urban densities. Urban development and provision of urban services, such as water and sewer, should not generally occur outside of urban growth areas. RCW 36.70A.130(3) requires counties and cities to review, at least every ten years, designated UGAs, the densities permitted within each UGA, and the nature of development that has occurred. UGAs and comprehensive plans are to be revised to accommodate the urban growth projected for the succeeding twenty-year period.",Feature Layer,"April 1, 2020",16,"['UGA', 'urban growth', 'Growth Management', 'Grant County', 'WA', 'land use planning']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/GrantCountyWA::urban-growth-area,2020-04-01

Comprehensive planning for Grant County will help ensure that the following goals will be accomplished:Tax dollars invested in public roads, water and sewer systems, fire stations, parks and other public services are spent wisely.Funding for development and capital improvement projects is secured. Long-range considerations are incorporated into decisions on short-range actions.Public interests, and the interest of the community at large, are promoted rather than the interests of individuals or special groups within the communities.Interests of property owners are protected.The analyses of existing conditions, issues, facilities, population projections, and other factors within the Comprehensive Plan will aid Grant County officials and the County Commissioners in their decision-making role. It seeks to establish a clear intent and policy base that can be used to develop and interpret municipal regulations. The Comprehensive Plan is also intended to maintain reasonable continuity in future decision-making as turnover occurs within the County's legislative body. However, the plan must be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect technological, social, economic, and political changes that may invalidate certain plans and policies.The Comprehensive Plan provides a legally recognized framework for making decisions about land use and other planning and policy priorities; however, it is fundamentally a policy document providing direction for how land use goals, policies, and regulations should be applied for the next 10 to 20 years in Grant County. The policies are required by the GMA to be implemented through the use of such regulatory tools as zoning and subdivision ordinances, as well as other innovative techniques. These regulations must be developed and maintained in accordance with the goals and policies of this Comprehensive Plan.Last update 1/17/2020.

As planning Canada's marine protected area network moves forward, the locations of future Oceans Act Marine Protected Areas will be selected based on a systematic and collaborative approach described in the National Framework for Canada's Network of Marine Protected Areas (2011). Currently, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has a number of Marine Protected Areas designated under the Oceans Act and Areas of Interest for new Marine Protected Areas at various stages of progress towards designation. These areas are ecologically significant, with species and/or properties that require special management consideration.

Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites in Canadian Waters,cgp_aafc,"Canada has the longest coastline in the world, measuring 243,790 kilometers. Many of our waterways along the coastline have to be dredged regularly to keep shipping channels and harbours open and safe for navigation; and this material is sometimes best disposed of at sea. Schedule 5 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) defines an exclusive list of materials and substances suitable for disposal at sea in Canada, which is in accordance with the London Protocol (1996). They are: dredged material, fish waste resulting from industrial fish processing operations, ships or platforms, inert and inorganic geological matter, uncontaminated organic matter of natural origin, and bulky substances. The disposal of any substance into the sea, on the seabed, in the subsoil of the seabed, or onto ice, from a ship, an aircraft, a platform or other structure is not allowed unless a permit is issued by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Disposal at Sea Program. Incineration at sea, as well as importing or exporting a substance for disposal at sea is also prohibited. More information on Disposal at Sea is available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/disposal-at-sea.html The Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites in Canadian Waters dataset provides spatial and related information of at-sea disposal sites approved for use in Canada in the last ten years and that remain open for consideration for additional use. Any additional use of a disposal site must be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of a valid Disposal at Sea permit.

Aboriginal Agreements,cgp_aafc,"The Aboriginal Agreements dataset contains the geographic boundaries as well as basic attributes data of arrangements between the government of Canada, provinces and territories, and Aboriginal organizations and communities. These arrangements are of Aboriginal and Northern issues such as education, economic development, child and family services, health, and housing. However, this dataset only contains the Aboriginal Agreements that have a geographic boundary. To view the list of all the Aboriginal Agreements, please visit http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100014686/1100100014687. The Aboriginal Agreements dataset includes: 1) Self-government agreements which represents the Aboriginal groups that govern their internal affairs and assume greater responsibility and control over the decision making that affects their communities. Self-government agreements which addresses the structure and accountability of Aboriginal governments, their law-making powers, financial arrangements and their responsibilities for providing programs and services to their members. Self-government enables Aboriginal governments to work in partnership with other governments and the private sector to promote economic development and improve social conditions. These boundaries represent the surveyed boundaries of the Aboriginal group’s Indian reserve. 2) Consultation agreements (Consultation protocol) which represents an agreement signed between the Aboriginal group and one or more parties that establish a consultation process. It sets out an orderly process through which the federal and/or provincial governments can consult with an Aboriginal group regarding a contemplated project or activity that may have adverse impacts on established or asserted Aboriginal or Treaty rights. These agreements include Federal Bilateral agreement, Federal Tripartite agreement and Other agreements. These boundaries are usually not surveyed but help to delineate the geographic extent of the agreement. 3) Other agreements is the catch-all category for any remaining geographies of signed agreements between the Aboriginal group and other parties, that do not fit within the aforementioned categories. These boundaries are usually not surveyed but help to delineate the geographic extent of the agreement. The Aboriginal Agreements dataset is part of the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information. The Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information represents the geographic boundaries of the solemn agreements between the Crown and the Aboriginal people, and set out promises, obligations and benefits for both parties. The following datasets are also available: 1) The Pre-1975 Treaties (Historic Treaties) dataset represents the large areas of land that the First Nations gave up to the Crown in exchange for such things as reserve lands, benefits or promises. 2) The Post-1975 Treaties (Modern Treaties) dataset represents the areas of Canada where Aboriginal land rights and title have not been addressed by treaty or through other legal means. Data-sharing agreements with the INAC’s internal groups (Negotiations Central and Implementation branch) as well as the Department of Natural Resources Canada are in place to ensure that any update to the attributes data or geography is reflected in the Treaties and Aboriginal Agreements geospatial information. This dataset is Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) primary source for Aboriginal Agreements geographic boundaries on maps. This dataset can also be viewed in the Aboriginal and Treaty Rights Information System (ATRIS). This web-based system provides access to information to inform governments, industry and other interested parties in determining their consultation obligations and in carrying out their consultation research.

DanPo DFO gisp Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas,cgp_aafc,"Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) are areas within Canada's oceans that have been identified through formal scientific assessments as having special biological or ecological significance when compared with the surrounding marine ecosystem. Failure to define an area as an EBSA does not mean that it is unimportant ecologically. All areas serve ecological functions to some extent and require sustainable management. Rather, areas identified as EBSAs should be viewed as the most important areas where, with existing knowledge, regulators and marine users should be particularly risk averse to ensure ecosystems remain healthy and productive. Why are EBSAs identified? EBSA information is used to inform marine planning, including environmental assessment and the siting of marine-based activities, by: - Informing and guiding project-specific or regional environmental assessments; - Informing and guiding industries and regulators in their planning and operations, for example: EBSAs have been acknowledged and referred to (often as ""Special Areas"" or ""Potentially Sensitive Areas"") in oil and gas related assessments; - EBSA information has been provided to proponents of submarine cable projects to be used for route planning purposes; - Informing and guiding Integrated Oceans Management (IOM) process within five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) and twelve marine bioregions; - Serving as a basis for the identification of Areas of Interest (AOIs) and of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (individually and in the context of planning bioregional networks of MPAs). How are EBSAs identified? The process used to identify EBSAs is generally comprised of two phases. The first phase involves compiling scientific data and knowledge of a marine area's ecosystems - notably fish species, marine mammals, sea birds, marine flora, marine productivity, physical and chemical conditions and geology. ""Knowledge"" includes experiential knowledge of long-time uses of the areas. In some cases (e.g., in the Arctic), substantial efforts are taken to collect traditional knowledge on ecosystems and environmental conditions from community members, fish harvests, hunters and individuals whose knowledge of the study area complement often helps fill scientific data gaps. In the second phase, the available information for a marine area (e.g. a bioregion) is assessed against five nationally-established science-based criteria including: - Uniqueness: How distinct is the ecosystem of an area compared to surrounding ones? - Aggregation: Whether or not species populate or convene to the study area? - Fitness consequence: How critical the area is to the life history of the species that use it (e.g. is it a spawning or feeding ground)? - Naturalness: How pristine or disturbed by human activities is the study area? - Resilience: What is the ability of the ecosystem to bounce back if it is disturbed? Progress to date and next steps EBSAs have been identified for large portions of Canada's Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as most of the Arctic oceans.

The process includes completing detailed ecological and socioeconomic assessments, setting conservation objectives, determining boundaries and management measures, and eventually developing the regulations under section 35 of the Oceans Act. Stakeholders are involved in each step of this process. There is considerable scientific evidence that marine protected areas provide a number of ecological benefits, including the enhanced recruitment of fish species, including those of commercial value, through the protection of spawning areas, larval sources, habitats and migration routes. A well-designed MPA network can scale these benefits up to the regional level, and provide benefits that individual marine protected areas cannot provide on their own. For example, strategically placing marine protected areas in a network can protect key stops along a species' migration route, and protect geographically distinct habitats that serve important life history functions.

Census subdivisions (CSDs) are classified into 53 types according to official designations adopted by provincial/territorial or federal authorities. Two exceptions are 'subdivision of unorganized' (SNO) in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 'subdivision of county municipality' (SC) in Nova Scotia, which are geographic areas created as equivalents for municipalities by Statistics Canada, in cooperation with those provinces, for the purpose of disseminating statistical data. The census subdivision type accompanies the census subdivision name in order to distinguish CSDs from each other, for example, Balmoral, VL (for the village of Balmoral) and Balmoral, P (for the parish / paroisse (municipalité de) of Balmoral).",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020","5,162","['Geographic data', 'Boundaries', 'Geographic data', 'Census', 'Statistics', 'Boundaries', 'StatCan', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', '90db78e2-eda2-4b2c-ae2e-a474187f2bf8']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/cc15ef8399e74f6aaf926ce17df236f4_0,2020-03-12
Post-1975 Treaties (Modern Treaties),cgp_aafc,"The Post-1975 Treaties (Modern Treaties) dataset contains the geographic boundaries as well as basic attributes data of all signed agreements that were negotiated after 1975. These boundaries represent the areas of Canada where Aboriginal land rights and title have not been addressed by treaty or through other legal means. These boundaries represent the final result of a negotiated First Nation’s claimed area. These boundaries are usually not surveyed but help to delineate the geographic extent of the rights of Aboriginal beneficiaries defined within the agreement. The Post-1975 Treaties dataset includes: 1) Overall Treaty Area (OTA) which is the broad area to which the agreement applies, often composed of the sum of the specific geographies defined within the treaty. 2) Treaty Settlement Lands that is wholly Aboriginal-owned and forms part of the “land and cash” settlements that are integral to the treaty. This category belongs to the Department of Natural Resources Canada and can be found on the Open data website as ‘‘Aboriginal Lands’’ classified as ‘‘Land Claim’’. 3) Treaty-Specified Rights Areas which category pertains to areas (lands or waters) where specific rights, activities or responsibilities apply pursuant to the treaty. 4) Other Treaty-related Geography is the catch-all category for any remaining geographies that do not fit within the aforementioned categories but do form part of the OTA, such as lands or marine areas designated for conservation or for specific projects.

Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites - 2018,cgp_aafc,"Canada has the longest coastline in the world, measuring 243,790 kilometers. Many of our waterways along the coastline have to be dredged regularly to keep shipping channels and harbours open and safe for navigation; and this material is sometimes best disposed of at sea. Schedule 5 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) defines an exclusive list of materials and substances suitable for disposal at sea in Canada, which is in accordance with the London Protocol (1996). They are: dredged material, fish waste resulting from industrial fish processing operations, ships or platforms, inert and inorganic geological matter, uncontaminated organic matter of natural origin, and bulky substances. The disposal of any substance into the sea, on the seabed, in the subsoil of the seabed, or onto ice, from a ship, an aircraft, a platform or other structure is not allowed unless a permit is issued by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Disposal at Sea Program. Incineration at sea, as well as importing or exporting a substance for disposal at sea is also prohibited. More information on Disposal at Sea is available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/disposal-at-sea.html The Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites in Canadian Waters dataset provides spatial and related information of at-sea disposal sites approved for use in Canada in the last ten years and that remain open for consideration for additional use. Any additional use of a disposal site must be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of a valid Disposal at Sea permit. The dataset may be of use in relation to Disposal at Sea permit applications. For some Disposal at Sea permit applications the data may be of use in assessing serious harm to fish under the Fisheries Act and assessing interference with navigation under the Navigation Protection Act.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",161,"['Atlantic', 'Nova Scotia', 'New Brunswick', 'PEI', 'Prince Edward Island', 'Newfoundland', 'Labrador', 'Quebec', 'BC', 'British Columbia', 'Canada', 'navigable waters', 'canadian ocean', 'Atlantic Region', 'ATL', 'Pacific and Yukon Region', 'PYR', 'Quebec Region', 'QC', 'Prairie and Northen Region', 'PNR', 'Downloadable Data', 'DAS', 'disposal at sea', 'disposal site boundaries', 'waste management', 'oceans', 'environment', 'pollution and waste', 'marine pollution', 'polygon', 'ocean disposal', 'disposal sites', 'Pollution and Waste', 'Oversee and Manage Site Conditions', 'Assess Environmental Impacts of Projects', 'Facilities or Disposal of Waste (on a Site)', 'National (CA)', 'Oceans', 'ECCC', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', 'da99526e-284f-4e06-8d04-193785cd1a96']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/8baefd424526498a8dc0b9f0b7c2e7da_0,2020-03-12

This dataset represents the 12-digit hydrologic units (HUC12) that drain, directly and indirectly, to the three estuaries. HUC12 drainage areas were sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) which contains a nested, hierarchical system of hydrologic units. Hydrologic units define the boundaries of surface water drainage to a given set of outlet points or a dendritic stream network. The boundaries are determined by topographic, hydrologic, and other relevant landscape characteristics. Within the Little Narragansett Bay watershed, NBEP delineated the drainage area for the western portion of Little Narragansett Bay. This area, “Part of Southeast Coastal-Pawcatuck River to Eastern Point,” drains to a smaller outlet than any hydrologic unit available in the WBD. All coastal watershed boundaries were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019).

Watershed boundaries were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019). This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

Watershed Protection Area Boundaries NBEP2017 (shapefile),NBEP | julia.bancroft,"Narragansett Bay, Little Narragansett Bay, and the Southwest Coastal Ponds are the three estuarine study areas under the purview of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program. This dataset represents Watershed Protection Areas (WPAs) that drain, directly and indirectly, into NBEP’s estuarine study areas. WPAs represent watershed management focal areas that are nested within NBEP river basins. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) defined WPAs for the purpose of developing watershed management plans. Each WPA encompasses one or more HUC12 subwatersheds, but some WPAs are not consistent with HUC12 drainage boundaries (e.g., Aquidneck Island). RIDEM and MassDEP have developed approaches to support watershed management plans that consider the geographical location, in some cases at varying scales, and the work conducted by different partners within the watershed. In the 2017 State of Narragansett Bay & Its Watershed Technical Report (nbep.org), indicator results are reported for WPAs to provide information that supports these efforts. The Estuary Program merged RIDEM’s WPAs and HUC12 subwatersheds in Massachusetts (this scale is comparable with RIDEM’s definition of WPAs). Based on early input by partners across the watershed, certain WPAs in Massachusetts were defined by grouping or dividing out HUC12 subwatersheds to capture special areas of interest for various watershed groups, for example, the Segreganset River watershed and Mill River watershed in Massachusetts. Coastal WPAs were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019). This dataset is intended for use in general planning, GIS analysis, and mapping at watershed and subwatershed scales.

HUC10 drainage areas were sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) which contains a nested, hierarchical system of hydrologic units. Hydrologic units define the boundaries of surface water drainage to a given set of outlet points or a dendritic stream network. The boundaries are determined by topographic, hydrologic, and other relevant landscape characteristics. Within the Little Narragansett Bay watershed, NBEP delineated the drainage area for the western portion of Little Narragansett Bay. This area, “Part of Southeast Coastal-Pawcatuck River to Eastern Point,” drains to a smaller outlet than any hydrologic unit available in the WBD. All coastal watershed boundaries were updated with NBEP’s estuarine coastline delineation (for details about NBEP’s coastline delineation, see metadata for BAYS_NBEP2019).

DP1 Port Coastal Management Area – This includes the existing Port Gisborne Basin, a section of the mouth of the Turanganui River, and the existing dredged navigation channel. It also includes two anchorage points and the dredged spoil dumping site in Poverty Bay.

Coastal Hazard Overlay,Gisborne District Council | GisborneDistrictCouncil,"Coastal hazards occur when a natural process has adverse effects on human safety, property or on objects or areas that are valued by humans, or when human activities generate anomalies in natural processes, causing those processes to act in unforeseen ways. Human responses to such hazards may, in turn, have other adverse effects on the environment and on the economic, social, and cultural well-being and health and safety of people. The Coastal Environment of the Gisborne District is defined in Part E of the Tairāwhiti Plan and shown on the planning maps. This Coastal Environment is particularly susceptible to a number of coastal hazards because the majority of people in the Gisborne District live close to, or use, the coast. These include: Tsunami, Storm surge inundation, Erosion, River mouth movement and Dune and Coastal Sediment movement. All of these events have occurred in the past within the Gisborne District. The entire Gisborne District coastline is subject to, and is likely to continue to be subject to, adverse effects from one or a combination of the natural hazards of sea and wind erosion, landslip and flooding from the sea and coastal rivers. Natural coastal hazards are an example of an issue which straddles the administrative boundary between the land and sea set up in the RMA. The majority of the coast has undergone an initial assessment of sensitivity to coastal hazards (ASCH). This represents a rapid and less rigorous assessment of the extent to which an area is subject to coastal hazards over a 100 year planning horizon. For areas where there is an identified coastal hazard problem, a rigorous and complete Coastal Hazard Overlay assessment has been undertaken. The assessments are based on an acceptable level of risk, and strike a balance between the expectations of members of the community to be able to use their land against the need to protect life, adjacent property, and values from coastal hazards on the other.",Feature Layer,"November 26, 2019",51,"['Planning', 'Coastal', 'Hazard', 'Gisborne']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::coastal-hazard-overlay,2019-11-26

Maine Wildlife Management Districts Layer,Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife | Jason.Czapiga@maine.gov_maine,"Wildlife Management Districts are delineated, geographical sections of the State that have similarities in biological and geophysical characteristics. Factors such as geographical location (western mountains vs. downeast coastal plain), soils, predominant forest types (northern hardwoods vs. spruce-fir), seasonal temperature variations, precipitation including annual snowfall, land use (northern forest vs. agricultural), and human population and development, etc., are variables that ultimately influence habitat and the abundance and diversity of wildlife. For each WMD, we made a concerted effort to select clearly recognizable physical boundaries to reduce confusion for hunters. Identification of Wildlife Management Districts benefits MDIFW and hunters in several ways. It helps biologists collect and evaluate data and fine-tune management recommendations. Hunters need refer to only one common set of boundaries for all species they pursue. We use all WMDs individually for managing deer. For other game, WMDs are combined, as needed, to form meaningful hunting zones.In 2000, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) undertook an effort to reduce the confusion of having different hunting zones for deer, moose, turkey, and waterfowl by designing a zoning system that met the management requirements for all species, while unifying boundary lines. As a result of that effort, Maine was divided into 30 parcels, and the term Wildlife Management Districts (WMDs) was born. Some of the boundaries of the Wildlife Management Districts were changed in 2006. There are now only 29 districts.In 2014, MDIFW again updated the WMD boundary written descriptions to reflect changes in road names and to correct other errors.  The dataset was  re-digitized using aerial imagery to reflect the description updates and to more accurately reflect the boundaries.",Feature Layer,"November 26, 2019",40,"['Maine', 'MaineIFW', 'MDIFW', 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'Wildlife Management', 'Hunting', 'geolibrary', 'WMD', 'boundaries']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::maine-wildlife-management-districts-layer,2019-11-26

River Lines,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.5) - June 2019 [Hosted Feature Layer]This service depicts rivers as lines and catchments as polygons The River Environment Classification (REC) is a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers. The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a re-cut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible when it was originally created.Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network. REC2 can be downloaded or streamed and used directly in ArcMap.

Town is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer that includes state, county and town (municipal) boundary features depicted on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps for the State of Connecticut. This layer only includes information for Connecticut. Line features include State, county, and town (municipal) boundaries. Polygon features depict the geographic areas for individual towns (municipalities). A town may be represented by more than one polygon feature. For example, in addition to representing the portion of a town on the mainland, a polygon feature may also define an island along the coast of Long Island Sound. The layer is based on information from USGS topographic quadrangle maps published between 1969 and 1984 and latitude and longitude coordinates that define the boundary between the states of Connecticut and New York in Long Island Sound. Attribute information is comprised of codes to classify and cartographically symbolize political boundaries by type and identify the geographic areas encompassed by individual towns. Polygon feature attributes include state, county, and town codes and names. Feature length and geographic area are encoded for linear and polygon features, respectively. This layer was originally published in 1994. With the exception of the Middletown-Portand town boundary, the 2005 edition, includes the same features originally published in 1994. The Middletown-Portand was corrected and changed from its location, as depicted on the USGS topographic quadrangle maps, from along the banks of the Connecticut River in Portand to the middle of the Connecticut River south of Wilcox Island to the Pecausett Meadows area in Portland.

Connecticut Parcels ,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"See full Data Guide here. Connecticut Parcels for Protected Open Space Mapping is a polygon feature-based layer that includes basic parcel-level information for some towns in Connecticut. This parcel layer includes information provided by individual municipalities. These parcel data are incomplete and out of date. The accuracy, currency and completeness of the data reflect the content of the data at the time DEEP acquired the data from the individual municipalities. Attribute information is comprised of values such as town name and map lot block number. These data are not updated by CT DEEP and should only be used as a general reference. Critical decisions involving parcel-level information should be based on more recently acquired information from the respective municipalities. These parcels are not to be considered legal boundaries such as boundaries determined from certain classified survey maps or deed descriptions. Parcel boundaries shown in this layer are based on information from municipalities used for property tax purposes. Largely due to differences in horizontal accuracy among various data layers, do not expect these parcel boundaries to line up exactly with or be properly postioned relative to features shown on other layers available from CT DEEP such as scanned USGS topography quadrangle maps, roads, hydrography, town boundaries, and even orthophotograpy. The data in the parcel layer was obtained from individual Connecticut municipalities. An effort was made to collect data once from each municipality. The data acquisition date for each set of municipally-supplied parcel data was not recorded and CT DEEP does not keep this information up-to-date. Consequently, these data are out-of-date, incomplete and do not reflect the current state of property ownership in these municipalities. These parcels are not to be considered legal boundaries such as boundaries determined from certain classified survey maps or deed descriptions. Parcel boundaries shown in this layer are based on information from municipalities used for property tax purposes. Parcel boundaries and attribute information have not been updated in this layer since the time the information was originally acquired by CT DEEP. For example, property boundaries are incorrect where subdivisions have occurred. Also, field attribute values are populated only if the information was supplied to CT DEEP. For example, parcels in some towns lack location (street name) information or possibly map lot block values. Therefore, field attributes are inconsistent, may include gaps, and do not represent complete sets of values among all towns. They should not be compared and analyzed across towns. It is emphasized that critical decisions involving parcel-level information be based on more recently obtained information from the respective municipalities. These data are only suitable for general reference purposes. Be cautious when using these data. Many Connecticut municipalities provide access to more up-to-date and more detailed property ownership information on the Internet.

Drainage Districts,Gisborne District Council | GisborneDistrictCouncil,"Stormwater drainage districts for the Gisborne district. Council owns and maintains a network of pipes and drains that form various stormwater drainage systems throughout our district. There are also many kilometres of open drains, creeks and streams on private property that the landowner is responsible to maintain. The drains Council owns and maintains are referred to as public drains. Contact us if you want to know if the drain on your property or elsewhere is private or public. Council owns and maintains a public stormwater system to protect people and property from flooding. The urban stormwater system covers Gisborne city including Wainui and Okitu and the following rural residential areas: Hicks Bay, Manutuke, Matawai, Patutahi, Ruatoria, Tikitiki, Ta Araroa, Te Karaka, Tokomaru Bay, Tolaga Bay, Te Puia Springs, Whatatutu. In rural residential areas, the urban public stormwater system is mostly located between the 70km - 100km speed zone. The residential zone is also used to determine the urban/rural boundary. The 'primary' urban stormwater system consists of around 140km of pipes with manholes, sumps and inlet/outlet structures. Also drains, swales, sumps, channels and detention areas. The piped system is designed to cater for a 10-year storm event, or a 10% probability of this sized rain event occurring each year. The ‘secondary’ stormwater system comes into action during significant heavy rain events. It consists of stormwater flow paths through reserves, private properties and alongside roads. It's designed to cater for a 100-year storm event, or a 1% probability of this sized rain event occurring each year. Just over 22km of significant streams, creeks and drains in Gisborne city are maintained on a regular basis. Many other minor drains in Gisborne city and some townships are maintained on an ‘as required’ basis.",Feature Layer,"September 19, 2019",33,"['Drainage', 'Utilities', 'Gisborne', 'Stormwater']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::drainage-districts,2019-09-19

No Net Fishing,Government of Bermuda | mandy_BDAGOV,"Seasonally Protected AreasTo protect spawning aggregation of Red Hind, Groupers and other species each year. Fisheries (Protected Areas)Order, 2005. The taking of fish in these areas from APRIL 15th through AUGUST 14th in any year is PROHIBITED. Spearfishing Exclusion ZoneThis nearshore zone in which spearfishing is prohibited is a longstanding management measure which removes spear fishers from swimming areas in order to reduce the likelihood of injuries to swimmers. There is also an environmental benefit in that the fish species particularly targeted by this method enjoy at least a partial harvest refuge in this area. Spearfishing is not permitted within one nautical mile (1 nm) of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda. This prohibits spearfishing in any of the harbours, bays or sounds and along the south shore. Any person found swimming within one nautical mile of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda while carrying a spear shall be presumed to be attempting to take fish.Protected Dive Site AreasBeginning in the late 1980s and culminating in 2000, a series of 29 popular dive sites were closed to all fishing and collecting activity. This was done because permanent moorings needed to be installed at the most popular sites to reduce anchor damage to the coral reef. It was felt that some separation of marine tourism and fishing activities was warranted, and that unless the areas around the moorings were closed to harvesting, the fishing boats would use them as well. These areas are declared to be year round protected areas as indicated in the Fisheries (Protected Area) Order, 1990. Line fishing, trapping, spear fishing and lobster diving are prohibited in these areas. Any person who takes any fish in a protected area or who sells, purchases or transports fish so taken, is liable on summary conviction, to imprisonment for two years or a fine of $50,000 or both such imprisonment and fine. Any fish so taken and any vessel, instrument and equipment used in the taking, shall be liable to forfeiture. Any person who uses within a protected area, any anchor other than a Danforth (sand) anchor, is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $2,500.No Net FishingThere bays are permanently closed to netting of any kind. In permitted areas recreational fishermen may only use bait nets or cast nets. Bait nets may not exceed 23 meters (75ft) in length and 2.7meters (9ft) in depth.No Lobster FishingSpiny lobster undertake significant migrations across the Bermuda platform, but are known to settle in inshore waters. Accordingly, this lobster fishing exclusion area, where no harvest is permitted, follows the entire inshore line of the islands and extends northward to the South Channel. This is a year round closed area for all lobster fishing. Diving for lobsters is permitted only in areas around Bermuda specified in the Annual Licence. Any person wishing to participate in recreational diving for lobsters must first obtain an Annual Licence for that purpose through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The Licence is valid from 1st September until 31st August. Important Bird AreaBirdLife International is a global partnership of conservation organisations that strives to conserve birds, their habitats and global biodiversity, working with people towards sustainablility in the use of natural resources.

Marine Protected Areas,Government of Bermuda | mandy_BDAGOV,"Seasonally Protected AreasTo protect spawning aggregation of Red Hind, Groupers and other species each year. Fisheries (Protected Areas)Order, 2005. The taking of fish in these areas from APRIL 15th through AUGUST 14th in any year is PROHIBITED. Spearfishing Exclusion ZoneThis nearshore zone in which spearfishing is prohibited is a longstanding management measure which removes spear fishers from swimming areas in order to reduce the likelihood of injuries to swimmers. There is also an environmental benefit in that the fish species particularly targeted by this method enjoy at least a partial harvest refuge in this area. Spearfishing is not permitted within one nautical mile (1 nm) of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda. This prohibits spearfishing in any of the harbours, bays or sounds and along the south shore. Any person found swimming within one nautical mile of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda while carrying a spear shall be presumed to be attempting to take fish.Protected Dive Site AreasBeginning in the late 1980s and culminating in 2000, a series of 29 popular dive sites were closed to all fishing and collecting activity. This was done because permanent moorings needed to be installed at the most popular sites to reduce anchor damage to the coral reef. It was felt that some separation of marine tourism and fishing activities was warranted, and that unless the areas around the moorings were closed to harvesting, the fishing boats would use them as well. These areas are declared to be year round protected areas as indicated in the Fisheries (Protected Area) Order, 1990. Line fishing, trapping, spear fishing and lobster diving are prohibited in these areas. Any person who takes any fish in a protected area or who sells, purchases or transports fish so taken, is liable on summary conviction, to imprisonment for two years or a fine of $50,000 or both such imprisonment and fine. Any fish so taken and any vessel, instrument and equipment used in the taking, shall be liable to forfeiture. Any person who uses within a protected area, any anchor other than a Danforth (sand) anchor, is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $2,500.No Net FishingThere bays are permanently closed to netting of any kind. In permitted areas recreational fishermen may only use bait nets or cast nets. Bait nets may not exceed 23 meters (75ft) in length and 2.7meters (9ft) in depth.No Lobster FishingSpiny lobster undertake significant migrations across the Bermuda platform, but are known to settle in inshore waters. Accordingly, this lobster fishing exclusion area, where no harvest is permitted, follows the entire inshore line of the islands and extends northward to the South Channel. This is a year round closed area for all lobster fishing. Diving for lobsters is permitted only in areas around Bermuda specified in the Annual Licence. Any person wishing to participate in recreational diving for lobsters must first obtain an Annual Licence for that purpose through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The Licence is valid from 1st September until 31st August.

Watersheds,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.5) - June 2019 [Hosted Feature Layer]This service depicts rivers as lines and catchments as polygons The River Environment Classification (REC) is a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers. The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a re-cut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible when it was originally created.Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network. REC2 can be downloaded or streamed and used directly in ArcMap.

There is also an environmental benefit in that the fish species particularly targeted by this method enjoy at least a partial harvest refuge in this area. Spearfishing is not permitted within one nautical mile (1 nm) of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda. This prohibits spearfishing in any of the harbours, bays or sounds and along the south shore. Any person found swimming within one nautical mile of the shore of any of the islands of Bermuda while carrying a spear shall be presumed to be attempting to take fish.Protected Dive Site AreasBeginning in the late 1980s and culminating in 2000, a series of 29 popular dive sites were closed to all fishing and collecting activity. This was done because permanent moorings needed to be installed at the most popular sites to reduce anchor damage to the coral reef. It was felt that some separation of marine tourism and fishing activities was warranted, and that unless the areas around the moorings were closed to harvesting, the fishing boats would use them as well. These areas are declared to be year round protected areas as indicated in the Fisheries (Protected Area) Order, 1990. Line fishing, trapping, spear fishing and lobster diving are prohibited in these areas. Any person who takes any fish in a protected area or who sells, purchases or transports fish so taken, is liable on summary conviction, to imprisonment for two years or a fine of $50,000 or both such imprisonment and fine. Any fish so taken and any vessel, instrument and equipment used in the taking, shall be liable to forfeiture. Any person who uses within a protected area, any anchor other than a Danforth (sand) anchor, is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $2,500.No Net FishingThere bays are permanently closed to netting of any kind. In permitted areas recreational fishermen may only use bait nets or cast nets. Bait nets may not exceed 23 meters (75ft) in length and 2.7meters (9ft) in depth.No Lobster FishingSpiny lobster undertake significant migrations across the Bermuda platform, but are known to settle in inshore waters.

Any person who uses within a protected area, any anchor other than a Danforth (sand) anchor, is liable on summary conviction to a fine of $2,500.No Net FishingThere bays are permanently closed to netting of any kind. In permitted areas recreational fishermen may only use bait nets or cast nets. Bait nets may not exceed 23 meters (75ft) in length and 2.7meters (9ft) in depth.No Lobster FishingSpiny lobster undertake significant migrations across the Bermuda platform, but are known to settle in inshore waters. Accordingly, this lobster fishing exclusion area, where no harvest is permitted, follows the entire inshore line of the islands and extends northward to the South Channel. This is a year round closed area for all lobster fishing. Diving for lobsters is permitted only in areas around Bermuda specified in the Annual Licence. Any person wishing to participate in recreational diving for lobsters must first obtain an Annual Licence for that purpose through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The Licence is valid from 1st September until 31st August. Important Bird AreaBirdLife International is a global partnership of conservation organisations that strives to conserve birds, their habitats and global biodiversity, working with people towards sustainablility in the use of natural resources. The Important Bird Area (IBA) programme of BirdLIfe International seeks to identify, document and conserve sites that are critical for the long-term viablity of bird populations. Bermuda's IBA supports the world population of the endangerd Bermuda Petrel (or Cahow) Pterodroma cahow, which breeds on four of the islets. Birds have been translocated to Nonsuch Island to establish a new breeding colony. The breeding population of White-tailed Tropic Bird Phaethon lepturus is globally significant. Coral Reef PreservesThis dataset shows the North Shore and South Shore Coral Reef Preserves as described by the Coral Reef Preserves Act, 1966. These are the oldest regulated marine areas currently in force. Their goal was to protect corals and the structural integrity of important areas of coral reef habitat when the advent of SCUBA diving made collection of corals a popular activity.  Line fishing is permitted through out this Preserve, as is lobster diving and spearfishing provided they are within the limits of the prevailing fisheries regulations. It is an offence to remove, damage or be in possession of plants or animals, whether dead or alive, which are attached to the coast, the seabed or any reef in this preserve.",Feature Layer,"June 10, 2019",2,"['bermuda', 'marine protected areas', 'protected areas']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/BDAGOV::seasonally-protected-areas,2019-06-10

Onondaga County Census Block Group 2010,Syracuse University | CommGeog,"The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.",Feature Layer,"February 21, 2019",380,['OnCo'],https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/SyrUniv::onondaga-county-census-block-group-2010,2019-02-21

Coastal Boundary,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"The Coastal Boundary layer is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer of the legal mylar-based maps adopted by the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) (i.e., maps were adopted on a town by town basis) showing the extent of lands and coastal waters as defined by Connecticut General Statute (C.G.S.) 22a-93(5)) within Connecticut's coastal area (defined by C.G.S. 22a-94(c)). The coastal boundary is a hybrid of the original 1:24,000 version maps prepared by DEP consistent with C.G.S. 22a-94(d) (Coastal Area) and the revised boundary mapping undertaken by twenty-two coastal towns prepared pursuant to C.G.S. 22a-94(f). This layer therefore does not replace the legal maps and may not be used for legal determinations. The Coastal Boundary layer includes a single polygon feature that represents the coastal boundary. No other features are included in this layer. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale. Attribute information is comprised of an Av_Legend attribute and a CoastB_Flg attribute to denote the coastal boundary. Other attributes include automatically calculated Shape_Length and Shape_Area fields. This data is not updated. Any regulated activity conducted within the coastal boundary by a municipal agency (i.e., plans of development, zoning regulations, municipal coastal programs and coastal site plan review (i.e., site plans submitted to zoning commission, subdivision or resubdivision plans submitted to planning commission, application for special permit or exception to the zoning or planning commissions or zoning board of appeals, variance submitted to zoning board of appeals and a referral of a municipal project)) must be conducted in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Connecticut Coastal Management Act (CMA; C.G.S. 22a-90 to 22a-113). As the Coastal Boundary is a hybrid of the Coastal Area, all state and federal agency activities must be consistent with the requirements of the CMA. As defined in C.G.S. 22a-94(b) the coastal boundary is a ""continuous line delineated on the landward side by the interior contour elevation of the one hundred year frequency coastal flood zone, as defined and determined by the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended (USC 42 Section 4101, P.L. 93-234), or a one thousand foot linear setback measured from the mean high water mark in coastal waters, or a one thousand foot linear setback measured from the inland boundary of tidal wetlands mapped under section 22a-20, whichever is farthest inland; and shall be delineated on the seaward side by the seaward extent of the jurisdiction of the state."" The original boundary maps were created in 1979 on stable mylar overlay using the 1:24,000-scale US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps (mylar film format). The source for tidal wetland maps were the legal 1:24,000 maps (mylar format) adopted by the Commissioner of DEP and transformed to 1:24,000 mylar-scale maps by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) using an accurate pantograph. OPM similarly converted FEMA's flood insurance maps (various scales) to a 1:24,000 mylar overlay. The inland extent of coastal waters was plotted on 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps following the procedures and sources described in The Boundary Between Saltwater and Freshwater in Connecticut, December 1978 prepared by the State of Connecticut, Department of Environmental Protection, Coastal Area Management Program. The following twenty-two towns have adopted municipal coastal boundaries: Chester, Clinton, Darien, Deep River, East Haven, Essex, Fairfield, Greenwich, Groton, Guilford, Hamden, Ledyard, Madison, Milford, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Old Lyme, Old Saybrook, Stamford and Waterford. The coastal boundary maps for these towns may be at different scales than the original DEP draft maps and may contain minor adjustments to the boundary as permitted in C.G.S. 22a-94(f).",Feature Layer,"December 21, 2018",1,"['Coastal Area', 'Connecticut Coastal Management Act', 'Coastal Boundary', 'Long Island Sound', 'Coastal Regulations', 'boundaries', 'Connecticut', 'CT', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'environmental', 'Environmental', 'coastal', 'area', 'open', 'data', 'open data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::coastal-boundary,2018-12-21

Activities and actions conducted within the coastal area by Federal and State Agencies (i.e., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE), DEP regulatory programs, and state plans and actions) must be consistent with all of the applicable standards and criteria contained in the Connecticut Coastal Management Act (C.G.S. 22a-90 to 22a-113). A subset of the Coastal Area, the Coastal Boundary, represents an area within which activities regulated or conducted by coastal municipalities must be consistent with the Coastal Management Act.

In 2017, a new Bermuda National Parks Amendment Act 2017 was created, incorporating most of the changes written in the 2009 amendment. With the opening of parliment in Sept 2017, it is anticipated that this amendment will be passed soon. The areas of land and/or water specified in the First Schedule are owned by the Government and are declared to be protected areas within the System and each such area shall be managed and administered so as to protect, maintain and enhance the natural or historic purposes for which it was specified in accordance wtih it classification in the First Schedule and its manaement plan. The classifications include Nature Reserves (Class A), Amenity Parks (Class B) and Recreational Parks (Class c). Marine Parks have been removed from the Schedule.
