0,Cairns 2004 corals,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"A total of 237 species of azooxanthellate Scleractinia are reported for the Australian region, including seamounts off the eastern coast. This study was based on approximately 5500 previously unreported specimens collected from 500 localities, as well as a re-examination of most of the types and previously reported specimens from the Australian region.Compared to all azooxanthellate species, those from Australia have a slightly higher percentage of species that are solitary and unattached (or transversely dividing), due to a disproportionate number of species in the families Flabellidae and Turbinoliidae. Bathymetrically they are typical of the worldwide fauna. Sixty-seven species are endemic to the Australian region.Azooxanthellate corals comprise half of the species and genera of the order Scleractinia (Cairns, 1999b), and, with the publication of this paper, consist of 703 species. Two hundred thirty-seven species, or one-third, of the azooxanthellate species occur off Australia, making it one of the richest regions in the world for this type of coral. The purpose of this paper was not to re-describe the azooxanthellate coral fauna of Australia, as most of the species have been adequately described and figured within the last 15 years in papers about the Australian fauna or adjacent regions (Cairns, 1989a, 1994, 1995, 1998, 1999a; Cairns &amp; Parker, 1992; Cairns &amp; Zibrowius, 1997). Instead, the primary purpose is to document and verify all previously published records of the 237 Australian azooxanthellate species in the form of annotated synonymies, to augment these reports with additional records from the various Australian museums, and to list deposition of types and type localities for all species. This exhaustive compilation then provides the basis for a meaningful zoogeographic analysis of this fauna, the second goal of the paper.Citation: Cairns, S.D. (2004).

7,Local Watershed Boundary,City of Newport News | organskitf_nngov,"The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation has more details on how the Hydrologic Unit Geography is maintained and explains what the VaNWBD is and how it differs from previous and coexisting hydrologic unit systems.. The City of Newport News is conducting its own survey and modeling to update these boundaries.A true watershed is an area of land and water defined by a boundary such that all surface drainage within the boundary converges to a single point. This point of convergence is usually the exit point or outlet, where the collected waters leave the watershed. There are, however, watersheds out of which no water flows.In contrast, hydrologic units are drainage areas that are delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system. Aside from the surface waters that are collected within the boundary of a hydrologic unit, it may also accept water from one or more points outside of the unit’s boundary. The tidal portion of the James River is a good example. It can be a hydrologic unit but not a watershed, because water enters this unit from both the non-tidal (Piedmont) James River at Richmond and the Appomattox River at Hopewell. Additionally, hydrologic units may include associated surface areas whose drainages do not connect, thus resulting in multiple outlet points. This is usually the case with coastal frontage units such as those containing multiple outlets to the Chesapeake Bay or Atlantic Ocean.",Feature Layer,"July 6, 2020",25,"['Local Watershed Boundary', 'Environment', 'MS4', 'Stormwater']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/nngov::local-watershed-boundary,Environment
8,Potential Karst Features,Tallahassee-Leon County GIS | cakee,"This Layer depicts potential Karst features in Tallahassee|Leon County, Florida. This layer is intended to be displayed with 20% transparency.What is Karst and why is it important?  Karst Waters InstituteKarst is a special type of landscape that is formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, including limestone and dolomite. Karst regions contain aquifers that are capable of providing large supplies of water.More than 25 percent of the world’s population either lives on or obtains its water from karst aquifers. In the United States, 20 percent of the land surface is karst and 40 percent of the groundwater used for drinking comes from karst aquifers.Karst features in Leon County are most fundamentally occur in depressions in the landscape. By delineating these depressions and analyzing their geomorphic characteristics, karst features can be mapped and classified according to their morphology. The process of identifying, delineating, and classifying karst features in Leon County is described below:Prepare Sink Depth Raster1: Fill sinks in countywide 2012 DEM2: Subtract original DEM from filled DEM to produce output raster of sinks with their depthsPrepare Contour data set to be used for forming Sink Polygons1: Create Z-negative 2-foot contours starting 1.5 feet blow the top of the sink. Smooth resulting contours2: Convert closed contours to polygons3: Merge polygons into multi-part features and explode into individual single-part polygons for each depressionPrepare classified Potential Karst polygons1: Eliminate polygons created from systematic noise in the Lidar-derived DEM2: Review remaining polygons features and assign feature attributes based on geomorphic characteristics. The karst feature types were assigned based on the classification system published by the Florida Springs Nomenclature Committee Report: FGS Special Publication 52< (available from the following link:https://www.sdii-global.com/sdii-dnn/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=IcZKjtknADA%3D&tabid=169",Feature Layer,"June 18, 2020","8,487","['karst', 'esa', 'environmental']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/tlcgis::potential-karst-features,Environment

Ecosystem service and fl ow frameworks seek to defi ne fl ows, or temporal fl uxes of materials, through a given systems. The basic difference between overlay analysis and material fl ow analysis for the environment is in the unit of analysis; where the unit of analysis in a fl ow framework is a volume of material over time per area, and the unit of analysis in overlay modeling is an ordinally ranked value of environmental quality for a given purpose.

Coastal hazards occur when a natural process has adverse effects on human safety, property or on objects or areas that are valued by humans, or when human activities generate anomalies in natural processes, causing those processes to act in unforeseen ways. Human responses to such hazards may, in turn, have other adverse effects on the environment and on the economic, social, and cultural well-being and health and safety of people. The Coastal Environment of the Gisborne District is defined in Part E of the Tairāwhiti Plan and shown on the planning maps. This Coastal Environment is particularly susceptible to a number of coastal hazards because the majority of people in the Gisborne District live close to, or use, the coast. These include: • Tsunami • Storm surge inundation • Erosion • River mouth movement • Dune and Coastal Sediment movement. All of these events have occurred in the past within the Gisborne District. The entire Gisborne District coastline is subject to, and is likely to continue to be subject to, adverse effects from one or a combination of the natural hazards of sea and wind erosion, landslip and flooding from the sea and coastal rivers. Natural coastal hazards are an example of an issue which straddles the administrative boundary between the land and sea set up in the RMA. The majority of the coast has undergone an initial assessment of sensitivity to coastal hazards (ASCH). This represents a rapid and less rigorous assessment of the extent to which an area is subject to coastal hazards over a 100 year planning horizon. For areas where there is an identified coastal hazard problem, a rigorous and complete Coastal Hazard Overlay assessment has been undertaken. The assessments are based on an acceptable level of risk, and strike a balance between the expectations of members of the community to be able to use their land against the need to protect life, adjacent property, and values from coastal hazards on the other.",Feature Layer,"November 26, 2019",11,"['Planning', 'Coastal', 'Hazard']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::areas-sensitive-to-coastal-hazards-asch,Environment

In the NZLRI the maximum erosion severity has been assessed for each LUC unit and this is based on the geology, soil type, steepness, climate and vegetation cover. The land overlays comprise the following LUC units: Land Overlay 1 Classes I-IV and VIe1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 inclusive, Land Overlay 2 Balance of Class VI, Land Overlay 3 (including 3A) Classes VII & VIII (see C7.1.5 for detailed units). Erosion is the natural process of soil and rock wearing away and being moved through the landscape. Erosion includes sheet, wind, creep, slump, flow, rill, earthflow, gully, tunnel gully and stream erosion. In areas undisturbed by human activity, the rate of erosion is determined by geology and weather. Land uses, particularly those that reduce vegetation cover or disturb the soil can lead to a much faster rate of erosion. This is especially heightened in naturally unstable areas where even relatively minor landuse activities can have major impacts.

65,Flood Hazard Areas,Gisborne District Council | GisborneDistrictCouncil,"Flood hazard assessments have been carried out for several areas in the District. These include the Poverty Bay Flats, Gisborne urban area, and the Mangatuna/ Wharekaka Area for the Hikuwai/Uawa River. The flood hazard varies across liable areas. Generally towards the edge of the flooded area depths are shallow and floodwaters move at slow speeds. Therefore the degree of hazard is low. However floodwaters are generally deep and flow swiftly in the vicinity of the main river channel and other major flood flow paths. These areas generally have a high degree of flood hazard with silt and debris deposition. The process of assessing flood hazard, firstly involves a study into flood behaviour. This involves estimating discharge for the various sized floods and the determination of water levels, velocities and depth of flooding. Then secondly a `design flood standard' is selected. The determination of that `design flood standard' balances the social, economic and ecological considerations against the consequences of flooding. If the standard is too low development will be inundated relatively frequently with greater damage. If the standard is too high land will incur unwarranted controls. The selection of the design flood standard depends on flood behaviour, landuse and consequences of larger floods. The level of protection offered by flood mitigation works may be different from the design flood standard adopted for land use planning. That level is dictated by economics of the situation or physical limitations of the site. It is prudent to assume that floods may occur greater than the ability of protection works to contain them. The design flood standard is intended to reduce the impacts of such floods, by avoiding or limiting development which would be affected.",Feature Layer,"September 21, 2019",347,"['Planning', 'Flood', 'Hazards', 'Gisborne']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::flood-hazard-areas,Environment

89,State Geologic Map Compilation – Structure,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) feature layer portrays the State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) geodatabase of the conterminous United States. It represents a seamless, spatial database of 48 State geologic maps that range from town sized scale (1:50,000) to county sized scale (1:1,000,000). A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data. The SGMC is a compilation of the individual USGS releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the U.S. It also contains updated data for seven states and seven entirely new state geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures.

90,State Geologic Map Compilation – Geology,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"This U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) feature layer portrays the State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) geodatabase of the conterminous United States. It represents a seamless, spatial database of 48 State geologic maps that range from town sized scale (1:50,000) to county sized scale (1:1,000,000). A national digital geologic map database is essential in interpreting other datasets that support numerous types of national-scale studies and assessments, such as those that provide geochemistry, remote sensing, or geophysical data. The SGMC is a compilation of the individual USGS releases of the Preliminary Integrated Geologic Map Databases for the U.S. It also contains updated data for seven states and seven entirely new state geologic maps that have been added since the preliminary databases were published. Numerous errors have been corrected and enhancements added to the preliminary datasets using thorough quality assurance/quality control procedures.

Farmland classification identifies map units as prime farmland, farmland of statewide importance, farmland of local importance, or unique farmland. Includes Locally Important Farmland Soils for the towns of Ashford, Canterbury, Chaplin, Eastford, Lebanon, Milford, New Milford, and Norfolk. This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

97,Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) Hydric Soils,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"See full Data Guide here. Hydric soils are defined as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part. Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. For additional documentation including a description of the map legend for Hydric Soils, refer to the CT ECO Complete Resource Guide for Hydric Soils. All soil information included in the CT ECO maps and map viewers is from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (WSS), which is based on information originally published on the set of Soil Survey quarter quadrangle maps that cover Connecticut. Hydric soil have a number of agricultural and nonagricultural applications. These include assistance in land-use planning, conservation planning, and assessment of potential wildlife habitat. A combination of the hydric soil, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydrology properties define wetlands as described in the National Food Security Act Manual (Soil Conservation Service, 1994) and the Corps of Engineers (COE) Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987) and COE Regional Supplements for the Clean Water Act Section 404 permit program. Section 404 requires a permit from the COE for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States, including wetlands. Therefore, an area that meets the hydric soil definition must also meet the hydrophytic vegetation and wetland hydrology definitions in order for it to be correctly classified as a jurisdictional wetland.",Feature Layer,"October 25, 2019",,"['soil survey', 'soils', 'Soil Survey Geographic', 'SSURGO', 'soil interpretation', 'hydric', 'wetland', 'prime farmland', 'parent material', 'subsurface sewage disposal', 'stormwater runnoff management', 'geoscience', 'open data', 'open', 'data', 'soil', 'survey', 'database']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::soil-survey-geographic-database-ssurgo-hydric-soils,Environment
98,Surface Water Quality Lines,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"See full Data Guide here. Surface Water Quality Classifications Set: This dataset is a line and a polygon feature-based layer compiled at 1:24,000 scale that includes water quality classification information for surface waters for all areas of the State of Connecticut. The Surface Water Quality Classifications and the Ground Water Quality Classifications are usually presented together as a depiction of water quality classifications in Connecticut. Water Quality Classifications, based on the adopted Water Quality Standards, establish designated uses for surface and ground waters and identify the criteria necessary to support those uses. This edition of the Surface Water Quality Classifications is based on the Water Quality Standards adopted on February 25, 2011. Surface Water means the waters of Long Island Sound, its harbors, embayments, tidal wetlands and creeks; rivers and streams, brooks, waterways, lakes, ponds, marshes, swamps, bogs, federal jurisdictional wetlands, and other natural or artificial, public or private, vernal or intermittent bodies of water, excluding groundwater. The surface waters includes the coastal waters as defined by Section 22a-93 of the Connecticut General Statutes and means those waters of Long Island Sound and its harbors, embayments, tidal rivers, streams and creeks, which contain a salinity concentration of at least five hundred parts per million under the low flow stream conditions as established by the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. The Surface Water Quality Classes are AA, A, B, SA and SB. All surface waters not otherwise classified are considered as Class A if they are in Class GA Ground Water Quality Classifications areas. Class AA designated uses are: existing or proposed drinking water, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use (maybe restricted), agricultural and industrial supply. Class A designated uses are: potential drinking water, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use, agricultural and industrial supply. Class B designated uses are: fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use, agricultural and industrial supply and other legitimate uses including navigation. Class B* surface water is a subset of Class B waters and is identical in all ways to the designated uses, criteria and standards for Class B waters except for the restriction on direct discharges. Coastal water and marine classifications are SA and SB. Class SA designated uses are: marine fish, shellfish and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting for direct human consumption, recreation and other legitimate uses including navigation. Class SB designated uses are: marine fish, shellfish and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting for transfer to approved areas for purification prior to human consumption, recreation and other legitimate uses including navigation. There are three elements that make up the Water Quality Standards which is an important element in Connecticut's clean water program. The first of these is the Standards themselves. The Standards set an overall policy for management of water quality in accordance with the directive of Section 22a-426 of the Connecticut General Statutes. The policies can be simply summarized by saying that the Department of Environmental Protection shall: Protect surface and ground waters from degradation, Segregate waters used for drinking from those that play a role in waste assimilation, Restore surface waters that have been used for waste assimilation to conditions suitable for fishing and swimming, Restore degraded ground water to protect existing and designated uses, Provide a framework for establishing priorities for pollution abatement and State funding for clean up, Adopt standards that promote the State's economy in harmony with the environment. The second element is the Criteria, the descriptive and numerical standards that describe the allowable parameters and goals for the various water quality classifications. The final element is the Classification Maps which identify the relationship between designated uses and the applicable Standards and Criteria for each class of surface and ground water. Although federal law requires adoption of Water Quality Standards for surface waters, Water Quality Standards for ground waters are not subject to federal review and approval. Connecticut's Standards recognize that surface and ground waters are interrelated and address the issue of competing use of ground waters for drinking and for waste water assimilation. These Standards specifically identify ground water quality goals, designated uses and those measures necessary for protection of public and private drinking water supplies; the principal use of Connecticut ground waters. These three elements comprise the Water Quality Standards and are adopted using the public participation procedures contained in Section 22a-426 of the Connecticut General Statutes. The Standards, Criteria and Maps are reviewed and revised roughly every three years. Any change is considered a revision requiring public participation. The public participation process consists of public meetings held at various locations around the State, notification of all chief elected officials, notice in the Connecticut Law Journal and a public hearing. The Classification Maps are the subject of separate public hearings which are held for the adoption of the map covering each major drainage basin in the State. The Water Quality Standards and Criteria documents are available on the DEP website, www.ct.gov/dep. The Surface Water Quality Classifications is a line and polygon feature-based layer is based primarily on the Adopted Water Quality Classifications Map Sheets. The map sheets were hand-drawn at 1:50,000-scale in ink on Mylar which had been underprinted with a USGS topographic map base. The information collected and compiled by major drainage basin from 1986 to 1997. Ground Water Quality Classifications are defined separately in a data layer comprised of polygon features. The Ground and Surface Water Quality Classifications do not represent conditions at any one particular point in time. During the conversion from a manually maintained to a digitally maintained statewide data layer the Housatonic River and Southwest Coastal Basins information was updated. A revision to the Water Quality Standards adopted February 25, 2011. These revisions included eliminating surface water quality classes C, D, SC, SD and all the two tiered classifications. The two tiered classifications included a classification for the present condition and a second classification for the designated use. All the tiered classifications were changed to the designated use classification. For example, classes B/A and C/A were changed to class A. The geographic extent of each the classification was not changed. The publication date of the digital data reflects the official adoption date of the most recent Water Quality Classifications. Within the data layer the adoption dates are: Housatonic and Southwest Basins - March 1999, Connecticut and South Central Basins - February 1993, Thames and Southeast Basins - December 1986.

120,Shellfish Bed Jurisdiction Lines,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Shellfish Beds Managed Set: The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection cooperated with the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Aquaculture to publish the Connecticut Mananged Shellfish Bed data. More recent information may now be available from Department of Agriculture since the time this information was originally published in 2004. Connecticut Shellfish Bed Mapping - The Town_Merge data layer is one of four layers that were created in the mapping of all managed shellfish beds in Connecticut waters. These beds, as defined below, include state managed beds, municipally managed beds, natural beds and recreational beds. These four bed types were mapped as separate data layers. This project was undertaken to assist three agencies, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) and the Connecticut Department of Agriculture Bureau of Aquaculture (DA/BA). While the over all goal of all three was the same, namely the protection of natural resources, each had different specific needs. The project was originally undertaken without NOAA involvement. In 2001Public Act PA01-115 An Act Concerning Recreational Fishing in Connecticut was passed. Information on this act can be found through the Connecticut State Library at http://www.cslib.org/psaindex.htm. This act required DA/DB and CTDEP to determine the ""effects of commercial and recreational fishing"" on eel grass beds. Harry Yamalis from the Office of Long Island Sound Programs (OLISP) initiated gathering information and mapping the beds on a part time basis in response to this Public Act. Later, NOAA requested assistance in building a national database of Marine Managed Areas (MMA) in accordance with federal Executive Order 13158 concerning Marine Protected Areas (MPA). NOAA and CTDEP agreed that the shellfish beds met the criteria for MMA's. Tom Ouellette from OLISP was the liaison between CTDEP and NOAA and became the project supervisor. Todd Coniff was hired as an intern through Coastal State Organization,which is overseeing the MMA inventory collection program for NOAA, to continue the work on a full time basis. Several people from the Environmental and Geographic Information Center at CTDEP provided technical and other guidance. As noted earlier each agency had its on agenda for mapping the shellfish beds. The follow paragraphs outline the wants and needs of NOAA, DA/BA and CTDEP. The following is a description of the process and function of the MMA inventory for NOAA. The following excerpt was taken from the MPA web site http://www.mpa.gov/. The Marine Managed Areas Inventory Database and Data Collection Process The inventory will contain a wide range of information on each site to help the U.S. develop a comprehensive picture of the nation's marine managed areas (MMAs). The data collected include a general description and site characteristics such as location, purpose, and type of site, along with detailed information on natural and cultural resources, legal authorities, site management, regulations, and restrictions (see MMA Inventory Database Description at http://www.mpa.gov/inventory/database_description.html).

The Bureau leases shellfish grounds, administers Perpetual Franchise grounds, provides survey and engineering services, maintains maps and records, collects fees and taxes, sets corner marker buoys, constructs and maintains signals and mediates boundary and ownership disputes. (2) The Bureau provides for the cultivation and propagation of shellfish through the management and restoration of state-owned natural clam and oyster beds. The continued availability of shellfish is critical to the stability and growth of commercial and recreational shellfishing. The Bureau issues Natural Bed and Conch Harvest licenses, sets corner markers, plants cultch, maintains spawn stock, monitors predators and diseases and makes assessments of natural disaster impacts.

121,Shellfish Bed Managed Polygon,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Shellfish Beds Managed Set: The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection cooperated with the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Aquaculture to publish the Connecticut Mananged Shellfish Bed data. More recent information may now be available from Department of Agriculture since the time this information was originally published in 2004. Connecticut Shellfish Bed Mapping - The Town_Merge data layer is one of four layers that were created in the mapping of all managed shellfish beds in Connecticut waters. These beds, as defined below, include state managed beds, municipally managed beds, natural beds and recreational beds. These four bed types were mapped as separate data layers. This project was undertaken to assist three agencies, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) and the Connecticut Department of Agriculture Bureau of Aquaculture (DA/BA). While the over all goal of all three was the same, namely the protection of natural resources, each had different specific needs. The project was originally undertaken without NOAA involvement. In 2001Public Act PA01-115 An Act Concerning Recreational Fishing in Connecticut was passed. Information on this act can be found through the Connecticut State Library at http://www.cslib.org/psaindex.htm. This act required DA/DB and CTDEP to determine the ""effects of commercial and recreational fishing"" on eel grass beds. Harry Yamalis from the Office of Long Island Sound Programs (OLISP) initiated gathering information and mapping the beds on a part time basis in response to this Public Act. Later, NOAA requested assistance in building a national database of Marine Managed Areas (MMA) in accordance with federal Executive Order 13158 concerning Marine Protected Areas (MPA). NOAA and CTDEP agreed that the shellfish beds met the criteria for MMA's. Tom Ouellette from OLISP was the liaison between CTDEP and NOAA and became the project supervisor. Todd Coniff was hired as an intern through Coastal State Organization,which is overseeing the MMA inventory collection program for NOAA, to continue the work on a full time basis. Several people from the Environmental and Geographic Information Center at CTDEP provided technical and other guidance. As noted earlier each agency had its on agenda for mapping the shellfish beds. The follow paragraphs outline the wants and needs of NOAA, DA/BA and CTDEP. The following is a description of the process and function of the MMA inventory for NOAA. The following excerpt was taken from the MPA web site http://www.mpa.gov/. The Marine Managed Areas Inventory Database and Data Collection Process The inventory will contain a wide range of information on each site to help the U.S. develop a comprehensive picture of the nation's marine managed areas (MMAs). The data collected include a general description and site characteristics such as location, purpose, and type of site, along with detailed information on natural and cultural resources, legal authorities, site management, regulations, and restrictions (see MMA Inventory Database Description at http://www.mpa.gov/inventory/database_description.html). The data collection process begins with agencies or authorities that manage marine and Great Lakes areas in U.S. waters. Each agency reviews sites in their programs to identify those that meet the MMA working criteria.

123,Tidal Wetlands 1970s,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Tidal Wetlands 1970's represents the historic regulatory tidal wetland boundaries produced during the early 1970's by the State of Connecticut Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources, which defined the areas of tidal wetlands that were subject to the 1969 Tidal Wetlands Act. The first comprehensive tidal wetlands mapping of the state was undertaken during the 1970's following the passing of the Tidal Wetland Act (TWA) in 1969. The TWA established a permit program to regulate activities conducted in tidal wetlands. The TWA had a mandatory mapping requirement to let property owners know the approximate location of regulated tidal wetland areas. Unfortunately, during the adoption of the regulations, the tidal wetland maps were given greater importance, than was originally intended, such that the maps were used to determine the regulated area rather than the actual site conditions. The mandated revisions to the maps were never undertaken as no additional funding was authorized. (See the Tidal Wetlands 1990's Datalayer for subsequent wetlands mapping.) The regulatory tidal wetland boundaries were surveyed in the field and these boundaries were transferred to 1"" = 200' (1: 24000 scale) mylars derived from black and white low altitude aerial photography. It is known that the mapping criteria did change and evolve as the surveyors became more experienced with tidal wetland delineation. It also was not unusual for controversial parcels to be omitted as a result of adverse comments received at public hearings prior to the adoption of the maps. Additionally, no maps were ever produced to show ""formerly connected"" wetlands, a special type of wetlands. Thus, even at the time of their adoption, the 1970's tidal wetland maps did not include all known tidal wetlands in Connecticut. For more information, please refer to the Tidal Wetlands Report at http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/gis/coastalresources/tidal_wetlands_report.pdf . The layer does not depict current conditions.

These assigned zone boundaries help address the wildlife management issues of the day and are subject to change as wildlife populations and management practices evolve. The last revision to the WMZ boundaries was March 27, 2014. This revision moves some boundaries to readily identifiable landmarks such as numbered highways, municipal roads or water bodies for ease of public use. Descriptions are written in a manner that better allows boundaries to follow highway or provincial forest boundary updates without ammending the regulation. These boundaries are described legally in the Wildlife Management Zones and Special Areas Boundaries Regulations, 1990 (shortened to WMZSABR for dataset naming). These regulations are in force under The Wildlife Act, 1998. Copies of these documents can be found at www.qp.gov.sk.ca. This spatial feature class is the polygon representation of the zones as described in the regulation. Although these digitized boundaries are intended to be as accurate as possible, the regulations supersede this data should discrepancies occur. The polygons you see here are constructed from the lines contained in the WMZ framework feature class, which is a clause by clause representation of the legal regulation. Regulation changes to the zones, when they occur, should be digitized in the framework first, and then constructed into polygons for this feature class.

146,Wildfire Hazard Potential,U.S. Federal Maps and Apps | Federal_User_Community,"Current Content: USA Wildland Fire PotentialThis map layer portrays the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP), developed by the U.S. Forest Service's (USFS) Fire Modeling Institute to help inform assessments of wildfire risk or prioritization of fuels management needs across large landscapes. The map service depicts the relative potential for those wildfires that would be difficult for suppression resources to contain.  This version of the WHP is based upon spatial estimates of wildfire likelihood & intensity. It is generated from the Large Fire Simulator (FSim) for the Fire Program Analysis system (FPA); spatial fuels and vegetation data from LANDFIRE 2010; and point locations of fire occurrence from FPA (ca. 1992 - 2012). The map service displays those areas within the continental United States that have different levels of fire potential, categorized by five WHP classes of (very low – very high) and two non-WHP classes (non-burnable and water). Areas with higher WHP values represent fuels with a higher probability of experiencing torching, crowning, and other forms of extreme fire behavior under conducive weather conditions. According to the USFS, the data is not an explicit map of wildfire threat or risk; nor is it a forecast or outlook model for any particular season. When paired with spatial data depicting resources and assets such as communities, structures, or power lines, it can approximate relative wildfire risk to those resources and assets.  It is instead intended for long-term strategic planning and fuels management.Wildfire PotentialData currency: 2014Data download: Previous WHP and WFP VersionsFor past data versions2012 Wildland Fire Potential2007 Wildland Fire PotentialFor additional information: USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station WHPFor feedback please contact: ArcGIScomNationalMaps@esri.comThumbnail image courtesy of Kari Greer",Raster Layer,"December 5, 2019",,"['USFS', 'USDA', 'forest service', 'Department of Agriculture', 'environment', 'biota', 'wildlands', 'fires', 'WHP', 'Wildfire Hazard Potential', 'U.S. Forest Service', 'U.S. Department of Agriculture', 'landcover', 'landscape', 'FPA', 'Fire Program Analysis', 'hazards', 'forest', 'federal']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/fedmaps::wildfire-hazard-potential,Environment

These new monuments were networked into the existing City of Kerrville Survey Coordinate System, a network of eleven similar monuments, two of which include the U.S.G.S triangulation stations “MORRISON” and “TIVY”. These existing city monuments were established in 1991 by McGuinness & Associates, Inc. of Hurst, Texas.The procedures for both the 1991 survey and this 1998 survey was the utilization of the Global Positioning System (GPS) using Trimble Navigation brand 4000 series receivers to perform static surveys of the control monuments and the newly established monuments.The operators of the GPS receivers were; Gary Brandenburg, RPLS, Cameron Mauze’, and Thomas Pattison, RPLS. The data was collected on February 14th and 15th, 1998 and the post processing of the raw data was performed by Michael D. McGuinness, RPLS of Western Data Systems, Inc. on February 21, 1998.

175,City of Kerrville Monuments 2003,City of Kerrville | opendata_kerrvilletx,"In February 2003, CDS Muery Services of San Antonio, TX contracted with Sanborn Map Company of San Antonio, TX to densify the existing City of Kerrville monumentation. The project required setting thirty-five new concrete monuments, paneling same points for aerial photography and establishing coordinates for the new stations on the same reported datum as the existing City of Kerrville control. This report and monument description sheets for the thirty-five new monuments are required as well.The new monuments were set in predetermined areas provided by Sanborn. The final locations were selected that provided the best window for satellite observation without obstructions and in locations that would be best protected from further development. The monuments were constructed of concrete and rebar with a brass disk stamped with “City of Kerrville”, station number and year.A total of thirty-seven panel locations were required for Sanborn to map the project and four of the existing City of Kerrville monuments were located and used to control the new points. The two additional locations Sanborn needed additional control were points 4035 and A608. 4035 is an iron rod with a CDS/Muery Services red plastic cap and A608 is an existing LCRA monument. On completion of setting the new monuments and paneling, a static GPS control network was designed that incorporated all forty-one points. The network contained closed loops of eight vectors or less and all forty-one points had double independent GPS observations.In March 2003, the static GPS observations were collected using four Trimble 4000Ssi dual frequency receivers and one Trimble 4700 frequency receiver. A total of sixty-two baselines were measure. No significant problems were encountered during the course of the field survey efforts.On completion of the static GPS observations, the data was downloaded and each independent baseline was post-processed using current Trimble Geomatics Office version 1.6 batch processing software and precise ephemeris data. The sixty-two three-dimensional baseline results were reviewed for input errors and then checked by performing loop closures.After reviewing the loop closure results a minimally constrained adjustment was performed by holding existing City of Kerrville monument 2300 fixed to its reported NAD-83(86) horizontal position and ellipsoidal height. The remainder of the network positions were free to be determined by only the magnitude and direction of the observed three-dimensional baseline vectors. The horizontal residual values of the adjusted points verses the published for the existing control monuments from the City of Kerrville ranged from 0.076ft. at monument 300 to 0.186ft. at monument 2200.Several network adjustments were performed holding various control points fixed in various combinations to get a better feel for how the existing control fit together. In the end a final constrained adjustment was performed holding all existing City of Kerrville control points fixed in their horizontal positions and only monument 2200 fixed vertically. The results of the adjustment should serve the needs required for the mapping.In conclusion, a sound GPS survey was performed that will give the City of Kerrville a densified network of survey control that is sufficient for the control of aerial mapping.Contact the City of Kerrville's Engineering Department to get a copy of the ""City of Kerrville Mapping and Monumentation Report 2003"" for more information about the project and the monuments.",Feature Layer,"January 29, 2020",37,"['survey', 'monument', 'elevation']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/kerrvilletx::city-of-kerrville-monuments-2003,Environment

182,National Wetlands Inventory,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | data_GNRC,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

194,Fire Severity Risk: State and Local Responsibility Areas,"California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, Fire and Resource Assessment Program (CAL FIRE - FRAP) | orgData","** This data set represents Moderate, High, and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in State Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) for the San Francisco Bay Region and surrounding counties. The data was assembled by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission from multiple shapefiles provided by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). The SRA data was extracted from a statewide shapefile and the LRA data is a combination of county shapefiles. All source files were downloaed from https://osfm.fire.ca.gov/divisions/wildfire-prevention-planning-engineering/wildland-hazards-building-codes/fire-hazard-severity-zones-maps/. **State Responsibility AreasPRC 4201 - 4204 and Govt. Code 51175-89 direct CAL FIRE to map areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and other relevant factors. These zones, referred to as Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ), define the application of various mitigation strategies to reduce risk associated with wildland fires. CAL FIRE is remapping Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) for State Responsibility Areas (SRA) and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ) recommendations in Local Responsibility Areas (LRA) to provide updated map zones, based on new data, science, and technology.The updated, statewide SRA data set was adopted by CAL FIRE on November 7, 2007.Local Responsibility AreasGovernment Code 51175-89 directs the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to identify areas of very high fire hazard severity zones within Local Responsibility Areas (LRA).  Mapping of the areas, referred to as Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ), is based on data and models of, potential fuels over a 30-50 year time horizon and their associated expected fire behavior, and expected burn probabilities to quantify the likelihood and nature of vegetation fire exposure (including firebrands) to buildings.  Details on the project and specific modeling methodology can be found at https://frap.cdf.ca.gov/projects/hazard/methods.html.  Local Responsibility Area VHFHSZ maps were initially developed in the mid-1990s and are now being updated based on improved science, mapping techniques, and data.Local government had 120 days to designate, by ordinance, very high fire hazard severity zones within their jurisdiction after receiving the CAL FIRE recommendations. Local governments were able to add additional VHFHSZs. There was no requirement for local government to report their final action to CAL FIRE when the recommended zones are adopted. Consequently, users are directed to the appropriate local entity (county, city, fire department, or Fire Protection District) to determine the status of the local fire hazard severity zone ordinance.In late 2005, to be effective in 2008, the California Building Commission adopted California Building Code Chapter 7A requiring new buildings in VHFHSZs to use ignition resistant construction methods and materials. These new codes include provisions to improve the ignition resistance of buildings, especially from firebrands. The updated very high fire hazard severity zones will be used by building officials for new building permits in LRA. The updated zones will also be used to identify property whose owners must comply with natural hazards disclosure requirements at time of property sale and 100 foot defensible space clearance. It is likely that the fire hazard severity zones will be used for updates to the safety element of general plans.Date VHFHSZ in Local Responsibility Areas were last updated (at time of data set development, see download page referenced above for potential newer releases):Alameda County - 2007-11Contra Costa County - 2009-01Marin County - 2008-10Napa County - 2008-09San Francisco - 2008-11 (CAL FIRE has determined that this county has no Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones in LRA.

Developed by NIWA with support from the Ministry for the Environment (MfE), Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries, and with contributions from several other stakeholders, the MEC provides a spatial framework for inventories of marine resources, environmental effects assessments, policy development and design of protected area networks. Two levels of spatial resolution are available within the MEC. A broad scale classification covers the entire EEZ at a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas the finer scale classification of the Hauraki Gulf region has a nominal spatial resolution of 200 m. Several spatially-explicit data layers describing the physical environment define the MEC. A physically-based classification was chosen because data on these physical variables were available or could be modelled, and because the pattern of the physical environment is a reasonable surrogate for biological pattern, particularly at larger spatial scales. Classes within the classification were defined using multivariate clustering methods. These produce hierarchal classifications that enable the user to delineate environmental variation at different levels of detail and associated spatial scales. Large biological datasets were used to tune the classification, so that the physically-based classes maximised discrimination of variation in biological composition at various levels of classification detail.

The risk of loss of life, injury or damage to property from the land instability hazard will be considered in this chapter. It is difficult to always be precise in identifying the land at risk as susceptibility factors are very site specific and require detailed risk investigation in consideration of the type of development proposed. Some areas are well recorded but the absence of information does not imply other areas are hazard free. For likely areas of urban or rural residential development, where soil and slope instability are of potential concern, or have had detailed hazard assessments carried out, a Site Caution Overlay indicates potential land instability. The Overlay acts as a signal to advise the public there may be additional site-specific controls required for protection measures or a need to avoid development. The site caution overlay does not include the general rural areas where although the potential land instability hazard is no less, sites are usually large with available space for a building platform. In these areas site suitable will be assessed at Building Consent Stage. Several areas have a heightened potential for adverse effects of land instability.

A recent study showed that there is a trend of less of these events, but when they occur more rain falls. Most areas north of Ruatoria have a higher average rainfall than the south of the district and can cope with high rainfall events. The Waikura Valley for example can get 200mms in a 24 hour period without any adverse effects. The populated areas likely to be worst affected in a large event are the Poverty Bay Flats, Te Karaka and the area just north of Tolaga Bay. More intense localised events such as the 1985 Ngatapa flood and the 1977 Glenroy flood also caused substantial damage. Most of the Poverty Bay Flats, during inundation, is not subject to fast flowing water but huge areas are subject to ponding, which after the water recedes, will leave thick layers of silt damaging pasture and fences. In the city a number of riverbank properties are at risk.

275,Satellite (VIIRS) Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity,City of Puyallup | ITGIS2018,"This layer presents detectable thermal activity from VIIRS satellites for the last 7 days. VIIRS Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity is a product of NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) Earth Observation Data, part of NASA's Earth Science Data.Source: NASA LANCE - VNP14IMG_NRT active fire detection - WorldScale/Resolution: 375-meterUpdate Frequency: Hourly using the aggregated live feed methodologyArea Covered: WorldWhat can I do with this layer?This layer represents the most frequently updated and most detailed global remotely sensed wildfire information. Detection attributes include time, location, and intensity. It can be used to track the location of fires from the recent past, a few hours up to seven days behind real time. This layer also shows the location of wildfire over the past 7 days as a time-enabled service so that the progress of fires over that timeframe can be reproduced as an animation.The VIIRS thermal activity layer can be used to visualize and assess wildfires worldwide. However, it should be noted that this dataset contains many “false positives” (e.g., oil/natural gas wells or volcanoes) since the satellite will detect any large thermal signal.Fire points in this service are generally available within 3 1/4 hours after detection by a VIIRS device. LANCE estimates availability at around 3 hours after detection, and esri livefeeds updates this feature layer every 15 minutes from LANCE.Even though these data display as point features, each point in fact represents a pixel that is >= 375 m high and wide. A point feature means somewhere in this pixel at least one ""hot"" spot was detected which may be a fire.VIIRS is a scanning radiometer device aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites that collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in several visible and infrared bands. The VIIRS Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity layer is a livefeed from a subset of the overall VIIRS imagery, in particular from NASA's VNP14IMG_NRT active fire detection product. The downloads are automatically downloaded from LANCE, NASA's near real time data and imagery site, every 15 minutes.The 375-m data complements the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Thermal Hotspots and Fire Activity layer; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters.Attribute informationLatitude and Longitude: The center point location of the 375 m (approximately) pixel flagged as containing one or more fires/hotspots.Satellite: Whether the detection was picked up by the Suomi NPP satellite (N) or NOAA-20 satellite (1). For best results, use the virtual field WhichSatellite, redefined by an arcade expression, that gives the complete satellite name.Confidence: The detection confidence is a quality flag of the individual hotspot/active fire pixel. This value is based on a collection of intermediate algorithm quantities used in the detection process. It is intended to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire pixels. Confidence values are set to low, nominal and high. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Nominal confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels.Please note: Low confidence nighttime pixels occur only over the geographic area extending from 11 deg E to 110 deg W and 7 deg N to 55 deg S. This area describes the region of influence of the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly which can cause spurious brightness temperatures in the mid-infrared channel I4 leading to potential false positive alarms. These have been removed from the NRT data distributed by FIRMS.FRP: Fire Radiative Power. Depicts the pixel-integrated fire radiative power in MW (MegaWatts). FRP provides information on the measured radiant heat output of detected fires. The amount of radiant heat energy liberated per unit time (the Fire Radiative Power) is thought to be related to the rate at which fuel is being consumed (Wooster et. al. (2005)).DayNight: D = Daytime fire, N = Nighttime fireNote about near real time data:Near real time data is not checked thoroughly before it's posted on LANCE or downloaded and posted to the Living Atlas. NASA's goal is to get vital fire information to its customers within three hours of observation time. However, the data is screened by a confidence algorithm which seeks to help users gauge the quality of individual hotspot/fire points. Low confidence daytime fire pixels are typically associated with areas of sun glint and lower relative temperature anomaly (<15K) in the mid-infrared channel I4. Medium confidence pixels are those free of potential sun glint contamination during the day and marked by strong (>15K) temperature anomaly in either day or nighttime data. High confidence fire pixels are associated with day or nighttime saturated pixels.This layer is provided for informational purposes and is not monitored 24/7 for accuracy and currency.",Feature Layer,"September 9, 2020","606,074","['Satellite', 'VIIRS', 'Hotspot', 'Fire', 'Wildfire', 'Activity', 'Environment', 'Hazard']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/puyallup::satellite-viirs-thermal-hotspots-and-fire-activity,Environment

296,Surface Water Quality Classifications Set,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"See full Data Guide here. Surface Water Quality Classifications Set: This dataset is a line and a polygon feature-based layer compiled at 1:24,000 scale that includes water quality classification information for surface waters for all areas of the State of Connecticut. The Surface Water Quality Classifications and the Ground Water Quality Classifications are usually presented together as a depiction of water quality classifications in Connecticut. Water Quality Classifications, based on the adopted Water Quality Standards, establish designated uses for surface and ground waters and identify the criteria necessary to support those uses. This edition of the Surface Water Quality Classifications is based on the Water Quality Standards adopted on February 25, 2011. Surface Water means the waters of Long Island Sound, its harbors, embayments, tidal wetlands and creeks; rivers and streams, brooks, waterways, lakes, ponds, marshes, swamps, bogs, federal jurisdictional wetlands, and other natural or artificial, public or private, vernal or intermittent bodies of water, excluding groundwater. The surface waters includes the coastal waters as defined by Section 22a-93 of the Connecticut General Statutes and means those waters of Long Island Sound and its harbors, embayments, tidal rivers, streams and creeks, which contain a salinity concentration of at least five hundred parts per million under the low flow stream conditions as established by the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. The Surface Water Quality Classes are AA, A, B, SA and SB. All surface waters not otherwise classified are considered as Class A if they are in Class GA Ground Water Quality Classifications areas. Class AA designated uses are: existing or proposed drinking water, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use (maybe restricted), agricultural and industrial supply. Class A designated uses are: potential drinking water, fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use, agricultural and industrial supply. Class B designated uses are: fish and wildlife habitat, recreational use, agricultural and industrial supply and other legitimate uses including navigation. Class B* surface water is a subset of Class B waters and is identical in all ways to the designated uses, criteria and standards for Class B waters except for the restriction on direct discharges. Coastal water and marine classifications are SA and SB. Class SA designated uses are: marine fish, shellfish and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting for direct human consumption, recreation and other legitimate uses including navigation. Class SB designated uses are: marine fish, shellfish and wildlife habitat, shellfish harvesting for transfer to approved areas for purification prior to human consumption, recreation and other legitimate uses including navigation. There are three elements that make up the Water Quality Standards which is an important element in Connecticut's clean water program. The first of these is the Standards themselves. The Standards set an overall policy for management of water quality in accordance with the directive of Section 22a-426 of the Connecticut General Statutes. The policies can be simply summarized by saying that the Department of Environmental Protection shall: Protect surface and ground waters from degradation, Segregate waters used for drinking from those that play a role in waste assimilation, Restore surface waters that have been used for waste assimilation to conditions suitable for fishing and swimming, Restore degraded ground water to protect existing and designated uses, Provide a framework for establishing priorities for pollution abatement and State funding for clean up, Adopt standards that promote the State's economy in harmony with the environment. The second element is the Criteria, the descriptive and numerical standards that describe the allowable parameters and goals for the various water quality classifications. The final element is the Classification Maps which identify the relationship between designated uses and the applicable Standards and Criteria for each class of surface and ground water. Although federal law requires adoption of Water Quality Standards for surface waters, Water Quality Standards for ground waters are not subject to federal review and approval. Connecticut's Standards recognize that surface and ground waters are interrelated and address the issue of competing use of ground waters for drinking and for waste water assimilation. These Standards specifically identify ground water quality goals, designated uses and those measures necessary for protection of public and private drinking water supplies; the principal use of Connecticut ground waters. These three elements comprise the Water Quality Standards and are adopted using the public participation procedures contained in Section 22a-426 of the Connecticut General Statutes. The Standards, Criteria and Maps are reviewed and revised roughly every three years. Any change is considered a revision requiring public participation. The public participation process consists of public meetings held at various locations around the State, notification of all chief elected officials, notice in the Connecticut Law Journal and a public hearing. The Classification Maps are the subject of separate public hearings which are held for the adoption of the map covering each major drainage basin in the State. The Water Quality Standards and Criteria documents are available on the DEP website, www.ct.gov/dep. The Surface Water Quality Classifications is a line and polygon feature-based layer is based primarily on the Adopted Water Quality Classifications Map Sheets. The map sheets were hand-drawn at 1:50,000-scale in ink on Mylar which had been underprinted with a USGS topographic map base. The information collected and compiled by major drainage basin from 1986 to 1997. Ground Water Quality Classifications are defined separately in a data layer comprised of polygon features. The Ground and Surface Water Quality Classifications do not represent conditions at any one particular point in time. During the conversion from a manually maintained to a digitally maintained statewide data layer the Housatonic River and Southwest Coastal Basins information was updated. A revision to the Water Quality Standards adopted February 25, 2011. These revisions included eliminating surface water quality classes C, D, SC, SD and all the two tiered classifications. The two tiered classifications included a classification for the present condition and a second classification for the designated use. All the tiered classifications were changed to the designated use classification. For example, classes B/A and C/A were changed to class A. The geographic extent of each the classification was not changed. The publication date of the digital data reflects the official adoption date of the most recent Water Quality Classifications. Within the data layer the adoption dates are: Housatonic and Southwest Basins - March 1999, Connecticut and South Central Basins - February 1993, Thames and Southeast Basins - December 1986. Ground water quality classifications may be separately from the surface water quality classifications under specific circumstances.

These habitats are known to host a number of rare species including highly specialized invertebrates with very specific habitat associations. Some key habitats are broken into subtypes based on natural variations in plant species dominance and/or vegetation structure. These differences are apparent in the subtype names. Connecticut Critical Habitats can serve to highlight ecologically significant areas and to target areas of species diversity. This layer can be used to perform various spatial analyses that pertain to Critical Habitats, to aid in determining site management and conservation priorities, prioritizing field surveys, and to further document the distribution and abundance of State-listed and/or rare vertebrate and invertebrate species within the significant habitats. Use this layer appropriately with data maintaining similar resolution.

299,Aquifer Protection Areas,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"See full Data Guide here. Aquifer Protection Areas is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon feature-based layer that includes all Preliminary (Level B) and Final (Level A) Aquifer Protection Areas approved by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). These areas represent the land area contributing ground water to active public water supply wells or well fields that serve more than 1000 people that are set in sand and gravel aquifers (stratified drift deposits). These areas are commonly referred to as wellhead protection areas. The Aquifer Protection Areas were delineated by the individual water utilities owning the well fields and submitted to the DEEP for approval. The preliminary mapping provides a general estimate of the area contributing ground water to the well field. The final mapping is based on extensive, site-specific, detailed modeling of the ground water flow system. As the final mapping is completed it replaces the preliminary mapping. The layer is based on information collected and compiled from 1991 to the present. The layer depicts current conditions. Attribute information is comprised of codes to uniquely identify individual features, encode the aquifer protection area type and status, and cartographically represent area features on a map. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale.

303,Quaternary Geology Geologic Basin Boundary,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Connecticut Quaternary Geology Geologic Basin Divides includes the drainage basins divides appearing on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples.

305,Connecticut Surficial Stratified Drift,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"These deposits originate from glacial meltwater, either deposited by streams, through settling in glacial lakes or in glacial marine environments. Stratified drift deposits are commonly located in major river valleys, where glacial meltwater drainage channels have persisted into modern times, and in dry valleys more common in the uplands where the deposits are remnants of ancient glacial drainage. These deposits are primarily comprised of one or more vertically stacked units of gravel, sand, and fine-grained deposits known as fines. For example, a coarse-grained stratified drift deposit can be comprised of solely gravel or gravel on the surface overlying sand below (e.g. vertically stacked). Connecticut Stratified Drift is derived from the Surficial Aquifer Texture compilation extracted from the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone et al 1992). Areas of surficial aquifer texture defined as coarse grained deposits either on the surface or in the subsurface are combined to create a single, coarse-grained stratified drift mapping unit. Stratified drift as coarse grained fluvial deposits, are variably sorted, and may or may not have a strongly layered appearance. Areas of surficial aquifer texture defined as fine grained deposits either on the surface or in the subsurface are combined to create a single, fine-grained stratified drift mapping unit. Course-Grained stratified drift deposits include the Coarse and the Fine overlying Coarse surficial texture classes. The Coarse texture class is comprised of the following surficial material deposits: Sand, Gravel, Sand and Gravel, Alluvium overlying Sand, Alluvium overlying Sand and Gravel, Alluvium overlying Sand and Gravel overlying Sand, Gravel overlying Sand, Gravel overlying Sand and Gravel, Gravel overlying Sand and Gravel overlying Sand, Sand and Gravel overlying Sand, Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Sand and Gravel, Sand overlying Gravel, Sand overlying Sand and Gravel, Swamp overlying Sand, Swamp overlying Sand and Gravel, Swamp overlying Sand overlying Sand and Gravel. The Fine overlying Coarse surficial texture class is comprised of the following surficial material deposits: Alluvium overlying Fines overlying Gravel, Alluvium overlying Fines overlying Sand, Alluvium overlying Fines overlying Sand and Gravel, Fines overlying Gravel, Fines overlying Sand, Fines overlying Sand and Gravel, Sand and Gravel overlying Fines overlying Sand and Gravel, Sand overlying Fines overlying Sand and Gravel, Swamp overlying Fines overlying Sand. Fine-Grained stratified drift deposits include the Fines and the Coarse overlying Fines surficial texture classes. The Fines texture class is comprised of the following surficial material deposits: Fines, Alluvium overlying Fines, Salt Marsh overlying Fines, and Swamp overlying Fines. The Coarse overlying Fine surficial texture class is comprised of the following surficial material deposits: Alluvium overlying Sand and Gravel overlying Fines, Alluvium overlying Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines, Alluvium overlying Sand overlying Fines, Gravel overlying Fines, Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines, Salt Marsh overlying Sand overlying Fines, Sand and Gravel overlying Fines, Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines, Sand overlying Fines, Swamp overlying Sand overlying Fines. The Surficial Aquifer Texture Map was prepared from the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone, J.R., Schafer, J.P., London, E.H. and Thompson, W.B., 1992, U.S. Geological Survey special map, 2 sheets, scale 1:125,000) to describe unconsolidated areas of the subsurface with similar properties relative to ground water flow. Surficial aquifers are unconsolidated geologic deposits capable of yielding a sufficient quantity of groundwater to wells. Surficial aquifer textures were identified from original surficial materials mapping for use in ground water applications. These are qualitative interpretations of material properties relative to ground water flow. Surficial aquifer texture groups were identified to represent aquifer textures with similar hydraulic conductivities. Some interpretations were made beneath postglacial alluvium and swamp deposits. Alluvium without a subsurface interpretation was classified as having similar hydrologic properties as till. Alluvium areas with subsurface interpretations of fines or coarse grained deposits were classified as having the hydrologic characteristics of the underlying deposits. The aquifer textures include areas of till, fine grained, fine overlying coarse grained, coarse grained, coarse overlying fine grained deposits, artificial fill, beach, salt marsh, swamp, and water. Aquifer texture groups include areas of fine grained , fine overlying coarse grained, coarse grained, and coarse overlying fine grained deposits. Surficial materials not included in the surficial aquifer texture groups include till, artificial fill, beach, salt marsh, swamp, and water. All textural terms follow the grain size classification of Stone et al 1992, modified from Wentworth, 1922. The surficial aquifer texture classifications are suitable for use at 1:24,000 scale. Original mapping of the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut is preserved as polygon attribute values in this data layer, and is herein described. The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. This map was compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. Connecticut Surficial Materials is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer describing the unconsolidated glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their grain-size distribution (texture) as compiled at 1:24,000 scale for the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut. Glacial meltwater deposits (stratified deposits) are particularly emphasized because these sediments are the major groundwater aquifers in the State and are also the major source of construction aggregate. These deposits are described in terms of their subsurface distribution of textures as well as their extent. The texture of meltwater deposits through their total vertical thickness in the subsurface is shown to the extent that it is known or can be inferred. In some places only one textural unit (such as SG - Sand and Gravel) describes the whole vertical extent of the meltwater deposits; in other places 'stacked units' (such as SG/S/F - Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines) indicate changes of textural units in the subsurface. Polygon features represent individual textural (surficial material) units with attributes that describe textural unit type and size. Examples of polygon features that are postglacial deposits include floodplain alluvium, swamp deposits, salt-marsh and estuarine deposits, talus, coastal beach and dune deposits, and artificial fill. Examples of glacial ice-laid deposits include till, thin till, thick till and end moraine deposits. Examples of glacial melt-water deposits include gravel, sand and gravel, sand, and very fine sand, silt and clay. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different textural units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale and is not updated. The occurrence of stratified drift deposits has significance for land drainage characteristics. Where the deposits are of reasonable thickness, they influence the transport and accumulation of ground water, waste water, and pollutants. These stratified drift deposits are also of economic value, as they are used widely in a number of societal applications, particularly in construction and roadway maintenance. Depending on local conditions, tratified drift deposits may or may not be good sources for groundwater aquifers. These stratiified drift data alone do not indicate the potential yield of ground water acquifers in Connecticut. Thick areas of course grained deposits are delineated on the Surficial Aquifer Potential Map of Connecticut. The Surficial Aquifer Potential Map of Connecticut may be a useful tool for watershed classification relative to potential ground water availability. Surficial aquifer texture groups were prepared to describe unconsolidated areas of the subsurface with similar properties relative to ground water flow. The Surficial Aquifer Texture classifications are based on the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut, and are 1:24,000-scale data suitable for geologic and environmental mapping and analysis purposes. Not intended for maps printed at map scales greater or more detailed than 1:24,000 scale (1 inch = 2,000 feet.). Not intended for analysis with other digital data compiled at scales greater than or more detailed than 1:24,000 scale. Development of the Surficial Aquifer Texture Map was supported by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Nonpoint Source Management Program, through Section 319 of the Federal Clean Water Act, administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Note, the Surficial Materials layer is complemented by the Quaternary Geology layer, which is based on the 1:24,000-scale compilation sheets for the 1:125,000-scale Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (U.S.G.S.

306,Long Island Sound Submerged Cable And Pipeline Areas,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"The Long Island Sound Submerged Cable and Pipeline Areas layer is a polygon feature-based layer that includes the location of submerged cable and/or pipeline areas in Long Island Sound. These can include, but are not necessarily limited to: electric transmission lines, telephone and/or fiber optic cables, natural gas and/or petroleum pipelines, etc. The layer is based on information from the 2002 edition of digital National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) nautical charts provided by Maptech, Inc., a field survey completed by Ocean Surveys Inc (OSI) in 2002, and the *proposed* location of a pipeline from plans provided by Broadwater Energy in 2005. The Long Island Sound Submerged Cable and Pipeline Areas layer was originally created during the summer of 2002. The layer represents conditions at particular points in time. The layer includes representations of areas of underwater cables and/or pipelines. It does not include cable and/or pipeline areas landward of mean high water, nor does it include all possible submerged cables, pipelines, or other similar features. Features are polygon locations that represent the approximate or assumed location of cables and/or pipelines for the purpose of cartographic representation and general planning. Attribute information is comprised of codes to uniquely identify individual features, encode cable/pipeline type of information, and cartographically represent (symbolize) cable/pipeline features on a map.

307,Quaternary Geology LIS Deltaic Deposits,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Connecticut Quaternary Geology Long Island Submerged Marine Fluvial-Estuarine, Channel-Fill Deposits identifies early postglacial, channel-fill deposits submerged in Long Island Sound and Fishers Island Sound. This information appears on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits.

Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples.

308,Quaternary Geology LIS Channel-Fill Deposits,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Connecticut Quaternary Geology Long Island Submerged Marine Fluvial-Estuarine, Channel-Fill Deposits identifies early postglacial, channel-fill deposits submerged in Long Island Sound and Fishers Island Sound. This information appears on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants.

Connecticut Quaternary Geology Long Island Submerged Marine Deltaic Deposits identifies early postglacial, marine deltaic deposits submerged in Long Island Sound. This information appears on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data.

Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples.

The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced.

Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples. Connecticut Quaternary Geology Long Island Sound End Moraine Deposits identifies glacial end moraines submerged in Long Island Sound and Fishers Island Sound and exposed on Long Island and Fishers Island, New York and Westerly, Rhode Island. This information appears on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example).

312,LIS Dredged Material Disposal Sites,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"LIS Dredged Material Disposal Sites is a polygon feature-based layer that depicts the official locations of the four active (currently used) sites for depositing sediments approved for open water disposal in Long Island Sound. It does not include historic or discontinued disposal sites. The layer was compiled initially between 1999 and 2001 and depicts current conditions. Compilation scale is unknown. Attribute information is comprised of codes to uniquely identify individual features (locations of dredge disposal sites), encode the features, and cartographically represent (symbolize) these features on a map. This layer is updated as needed. Disposal activities in Long Island Sound are regulated by the following Federal statutes: the Clean Water Acts of 1977, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. In addition to Federal oversight, both Connecticut and New York also regulate open water disposal in the waters of Long Island Sound. In Connecticut, authority stems from the state's Structures, Dredging and Fill statute, the Tidal Wetlands statute, and the Connecticut Coastal Management Act. In New York, disposal is regulated through the Use and Protection of Waters Regulation, the Tidal Wetlands Use Regulations, the Coastal Erosion Management Regulations, the State Environmental Quality Review Act, the State Historic Preservation Act, the Waterfront Revitalization and Coastal Resources Act, and the New York Coastal Management Program. The practice of open water disposal in Long Island Sound utilizes one of the following management strategies: 1. Unconfined Open Water Disposal: A process by which material deemed to be environmentally safe is deposited at a given site. 2. Confined Open Water Disposal: A process by which sediments not suitable for unconfined open water disposal are deposited and then covered or ""capped"" with environmentally safe material. A variation of this method occurs when previous sediment mounds are used to form a ring into which material not suitable for unconfined open water disposal can be placed and then capped accordingly. The datalayer was originally created from information provided by: (1) Carey, D., Valente R., Murray P., and Rhoads, D. 1998. State of Connecticut Dept. of Environmental Protection Office of Long Island Sound Programs Dredged Sediment Management Study: Long Island Sound Dredged Material Management Approach. SAIC Peport No. 442, Science Applications International Corporation. Appendix F.; and (2) Various US ACOE DAMOS Monitoring Cruise Reports, 1991-2000. Updates for the 2005 edition included information from The Final Rulemaking and Response to Comments Document for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Designation of Dredged Material Disposal Sites in Central and Western Long Island Sound, US Environmental Protection Agency, May 19, 2005. As part of the overall management approach, the four sites have been extensively monitored by the US Army Corps of Engineer's (ACOE) Disposal Area MOnitoring System (DAMOS) since 1977. Each site is briefly summarized as follows: Western Long Island Sound Disposal Site: The Western Long Island Sound Disposal Site (WLIS) is located 4.63 km south of Long Neck Point, CT. Dredged material has been deposited annually at the 5.35 km2 site since 1982 and consists mainly of fine silts and clays. Sensitive local resources and public concern limit disposal to material with only low levels of contamination, therefore, only unconfined open water disposal is employed. WLIS has been extensively monitored by the DAMOS program since the mid 1980's. Feature data updated as of 2005. Central Long Island Sound Disposal Site: The Central Long Island Sound Disposal Site (CLIS) was designated in 1979 and incorporates a previous disposal area, the New Haven Disposal Site, that was in use since 1972. Currently, CLIS encompasses an area of 8.26 km2 and is located approximately 10.37 km south of South End Point in East Haven CT. Because of its centralized location in Long Island Sound CLIS has been one of the most historically active disposal sites in New England. Characterized by predominantly silty material, CLIS mainly uses a confined disposal strategy, and the site has been monitored by DAMOS since 1977. Feature data updated as of 2005. Cornfield Shoals Disposal Site: The Cornfield Shoals Disposal Site (CSDS) was designated for dredged material disposal in 1976 and is located 6.12 km southeast of Cornfield Point, Old Saybrook, CT. Because of strong tidal currents in the area material deposited at CSDS is usually dispersed following release, often being transported outside the boundaries of the 3.42 km2 site. Therefore material disposed at CSDS cannot be capped and must be shown to have no adverse impact to the environment. Average annual disposal volumes at CSDS are much less than the other sites, and are typically characterized by sandy sediments. Disposal is restricted from June 1 through September 30 to protect lobster fishing and oyster spawning during the summer. CSDS has been monitored by the DAMOS program since 1978. New London Disposal Site: The New London Disposal Site (NLDS) is located 5.38 km south of Eastern Point in Groton, CT. The 3.42 km2 site is the shallowest of the four sites, ranging in depth from 14 to 24 meters, and has two distinct management areas within its boundaries. One is the 300 meter wide submarine transit corridor to allow passage for submarines to the US Navy base in Groton, CT, and the other is the New York-Connecticut state boundary line (approximately 0.43 km2 of the south east corner of NLDS lies in New York state waters.) Similar to CLIS, confined disposal methods are suitable for NLDS. Because of lobster fishing and oyster spawning during the summer, disposal is restricted at CLIS from June 1 through September 30. NLDS has been actively monitored by DAMOS since 1977.",Feature Layer,"October 18, 2019",4,"['Coastal Area', 'Connecticut Coastal Management Act', 'Coastal Boundary', 'Long Island Sound', 'Coastal Regulations', 'boundaries', 'Connecticut', 'CT', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'Environmental', 'LIS', 'long', 'island', 'sound', 'dredged', 'material', 'disposal', 'sites']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::lis-dredged-material-disposal-sites,Environment

321,Shellfish Beds Managed Set,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Shellfish Beds Managed Set: The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection cooperated with the Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Aquaculture to publish the Connecticut Mananged Shellfish Bed data. More recent information may now be available from Department of Agriculture since the time this information was originally published in 2004. Connecticut Shellfish Bed Mapping - The Town_Merge data layer is one of four layers that were created in the mapping of all managed shellfish beds in Connecticut waters. These beds, as defined below, include state managed beds, municipally managed beds, natural beds and recreational beds. These four bed types were mapped as separate data layers. This project was undertaken to assist three agencies, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CTDEP) and the Connecticut Department of Agriculture Bureau of Aquaculture (DA/BA). While the over all goal of all three was the same, namely the protection of natural resources, each had different specific needs. The project was originally undertaken without NOAA involvement. In 2001Public Act PA01-115 An Act Concerning Recreational Fishing in Connecticut was passed. Information on this act can be found through the Connecticut State Library at http://www.cslib.org/psaindex.htm. This act required DA/DB and CTDEP to determine the ""effects of commercial and recreational fishing"" on eel grass beds. Harry Yamalis from the Office of Long Island Sound Programs (OLISP) initiated gathering information and mapping the beds on a part time basis in response to this Public Act. Later, NOAA requested assistance in building a national database of Marine Managed Areas (MMA) in accordance with federal Executive Order 13158 concerning Marine Protected Areas (MPA). NOAA and CTDEP agreed that the shellfish beds met the criteria for MMA's. Tom Ouellette from OLISP was the liaison between CTDEP and NOAA and became the project supervisor. Todd Coniff was hired as an intern through Coastal State Organization,which is overseeing the MMA inventory collection program for NOAA, to continue the work on a full time basis. Several people from the Environmental and Geographic Information Center at CTDEP provided technical and other guidance. As noted earlier each agency had its on agenda for mapping the shellfish beds. The follow paragraphs outline the wants and needs of NOAA, DA/BA and CTDEP. The following is a description of the process and function of the MMA inventory for NOAA. The following excerpt was taken from the MPA web site http://www.mpa.gov/. The Marine Managed Areas Inventory Database and Data Collection Process The inventory will contain a wide range of information on each site to help the U.S. develop a comprehensive picture of the nation's marine managed areas (MMAs). The data collected include a general description and site characteristics such as location, purpose, and type of site, along with detailed information on natural and cultural resources, legal authorities, site management, regulations, and restrictions (see MMA Inventory Database Description at http://www.mpa.gov/inventory/database_description.html). The data collection process begins with agencies or authorities that manage marine and Great Lakes areas in U.S. waters. Each agency reviews sites in their programs to identify those that meet the MMA working criteria. Data collection is then conducted for each site by the managing agency with an electronic data entry form. The managing agencies also review and approve the data before submission to the NOAA/Department of the Interior Inventory team. The data are then reviewed and made public on MPA.GOV. A data update and revision process is being developed to ensure that the information in the inventory is kept current over time Purposes of MMA Inventory The national inventory provides a range of data on all types of MMAs in the U.S. This database can help federal, regional, state, and local, managers, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and the public to better analyze and understand information about these sites, management capabilities, effectiveness, and evaluation processes. DA/BA wanted the shellfish beds mapped to better meet their statutory obligations and more efficiently run some of their programs. There are two main programs that will directly benefit from this mapping: 1) Shellfish Habitat Management and Restoration and 2) Aquaculture Development and Coordination. Both of these are explained on the DA/BA web site http://vvv.state.ct.us/doag/business/aquac/oyscharg.htm - PROGRAM. Shellfish Habitat Management and Restoration: This program serves two functions: (1) It provides a mechanism for shellfish aquaculturists to obtain underwater lands in Long Island Sound for the purpose of planting, cultivating and harvesting shellfish and serves as the foundation for the State's multimillion dollar shellfish industry. The Bureau leases shellfish grounds, administers Perpetual Franchise grounds, provides survey and engineering services, maintains maps and records, collects fees and taxes, sets corner marker buoys, constructs and maintains signals and mediates boundary and ownership disputes. (2) The Bureau provides for the cultivation and propagation of shellfish through the management and restoration of state-owned natural clam and oyster beds. The continued availability of shellfish is critical to the stability and growth of commercial and recreational shellfishing. The Bureau issues Natural Bed and Conch Harvest licenses, sets corner markers, plants cultch, maintains spawn stock, monitors predators and diseases and makes assessments of natural disaster impacts. Aquaculture Development and Coordination: This program is responsible for planning and coordinating aquaculture development including: development and oversight of legislation and regulations, review of NPDES and Coastal Zone applications, liaison between industry and the regulatory community, promotion, marketing, technology transfer and assistance, communications and addresses issues of regional and national concern. In Connecticut, shellfish are defined as oysters, clams, mussels and scallops; either shucked or in the shell, fresh or frozen, whole or in part. Scallops are excluded from this definition when the final product is the shucked adductor muscle only. Lobsters, crabs, snails and finfish are not included in this definition.",Feature Service,"April 17, 2020",,"['Environmental', 'Natural Shellfish Beds', 'Oyster', 'coastal resource', 'Clam', 'Scallop', 'Aquaculture', 'Shellfish', 'Department of Agriculture', 'Department of Environmental Protection', 'data', 'open data', 'open', 'beds', 'managed', 'set', 'mussel']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::shellfish-beds-managed-set,Environment

325,Tidal Wetlands 1990s,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"In 1995 it was recognized that current Connecticut tidal wetland boundary information was critical to ensure the appropriate management and protection of the tidal wetlands resource. At this time the 1970's maps had become increasingly dated, with the growth of new tidal wetland areas and the restoration of others. The maps were contributing to the confusion over state versus municipal wetland jurisdiction. It was in this climate that the current project was conceived. The aim of this mapping effort was to provide current, geometrically correct tidal wetland map products that would serve as a guide to the jurisdictional boundaries for federal, state and municipal regulators and private land holders. 'Tidal Wetlands' are defined as follows: 'Tidal Wetlands' means 'wetland' as defined by C.G.S.Sec. 22a-29. C.G.S.Sec.22a-93(7)(E). 'Wetland' means those areas which border or lie beneath tidal waters, such as, but not limited to banks, bogs, salt marshes, swamps, meadows, flats, or other low lands subject to tidal action, including those areas now or formerly connected to tidal waters, and whose surface is at or below an elevation of one foot above local extreme high water; and upon which may grow or be capable of growing some but not necessarily all, of the following: (See the statute for a complete listing of tidally influenced plant species) C.G.S.Sec.22a-29(2). Thus, the actual tidal wetland boundary is determined by the application of these criteria, including identifying the presence or absence of tidally influenced plants. While the field determination of these criteria results in the most accurate tidal wetland boundary delineation, the identification of different plant types and low lying areas can also be achieved, at a high level of accuracy, through the use of large scale, stereo aerial photography. This latter method was determined as being the most efficient method to delineate vegetated tidal wetlands across the entire state of Connecticut. It should be noted that similarly to the previous tidal wetlands mapping efforts, no attempt was made to delineate those areas that were formerly connected to tidal flow, as these areas are difficult to identify by either field or photo interpretation techniques. The area mapped in the Tidal Wetlands 1990's datalayer includes all tidal, coastal and navigable waters and tidal wetlands of Connecticut with the exception of the Lower Connecticut River, which was mapped as part of the 1994 Ramsar Convention program. Between both programs, a total of 15,178 acres of tidal wetlands were mapped.",Feature Layer,"October 17, 2019","2,827","['biota', 'boundaries', 'environment', 'CT', 'Bioscience', 'Coast', 'Coastal', 'Coastline', 'tidal', 'wetlands', 'open', 'open data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::tidal-wetlands-1990s,Environment
326,Eelgrass Beds 93-95 Observed Polygon,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Eelgrass Beds 93-95 Set: Eelgrass Sample Points is a 1:24,000-scale, point feature-based layer that depicts the locations where eelgrass (Zostera marina) was either observed or where a location would be potentially favorable for future eelgrass growth. Sample points were taken along Connecticut's coast in Long Island Sound, and in major bays, harbors and rivers along the shoreline. The point features in this layer were compiled from field research using global positioning system (GPS) equipment. Feature locations were not always exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. Some point locations were corrected based on field notes or hydrography and bathymetry conditions at the sample point location. The number of field points that were altered were as follows: In 1993, 32 of 290 points (11%); in 1994, 93 of 454 points (20%); in 1995, 37 of 105 points (35%). Data compilation occurred on 17 days between 7/21/1993 and 11/16/1995; exact dates of each source's data collection are noted in the attribute table. A total of 849 point locations were surveyed. The westernmost point is Frash Pond in Stratford, Connecticut and the easternmost point is the Pawcatuck River on the Connecticut/Rhode Island Border. Eelgrass was found at 484 locations and was described as either high, medium, or low density, or simply as present or absent. Eelgrass was absent at 365 locations. Publication of the datalayer was in 1997. This layer is not updated. This layer does not represent current conditions. Observed Eelgrass Beds is a 1:24,000 scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of observed eelgrass beds in Long Island Sound, in major rivers, and within bays, harbors and other waterbodies along Connecticut's coast. The layer is based on information from the Eelgrass Sample Points layer. It represents conditions at a particular point in time (1993 to 1995). During the 1993-95 field seasons a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology led by Charles Yarish, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), SCUBA, and a 20' boat surveyed over 800 potential eelgrass locations. Their GPS coordinates and field notes were used to create a point coverage entitled Eelgrass Sample Points, which was plotted and checked on a 1:24000 scale base map of the Connecticut shore. These point locations, observations, and the nearshore bathymetry were then used to delineate areas representing both observed and potential eelgrass beds. Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Keeping in mind the temporal and spatial variability of eelgrass, beds may vary in size, shape, and density from year to year. Feature locations may not always be exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. It should be noted that the Observed Eelgrass Beds layer is not a complete dataset of all observed eelgrass sites in Connecticut and/or Long Island Sound. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated. It does not represent current conditions. There are 101 polygon features representing observed eelgrass beds in this layer. Geographic locations are as follows: westernmost areas: Clinton Harbor; easternmost areas: Little Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island waters. Observed beds range in size from .003 acre (131 sq. ft.) to 49 acres (2,136,608 sq. ft.). The total area of observed beds is 632.6 acres. Potential Eelgrass Beds is a 1:24,000 scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of potential eelgrass beds in Long Island Sound, in major rivers, and within bays, harbors and other waterbodies along Connecticut's coast. The layer is based on information from the Observed Eelgrass Beds and Eelgrass Sample Points layers. It represents conditions at a particular point in time (1993 to 1995). During the 1993-95 field seasons a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology led by Charles Yarish, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), SCUBA, and a 20' boat surveyed over 800 potential eelgrass locations. Their GPS coordinates and field notes were used to create a point coverage entitled Eelgrass Sample Points, which was plotted and checked on a 1:24000 scale base map of the Connecticut shore. These point locations, observations, and the nearshore bathymetry were then used to delineate areas representing both observed and potential eelgrass beds. Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Potential beds, where not individually delineated, were created by buffering observed beds a distance of 33 feet (10 meters). These buffered polygons were intersected with buffered (distance of 5 ft.) shoreline arcs to keep potential polygons a minimum distance off the shoreline. These potential beds are considered to be areas where eelgrass is likely to spread to under ideal conditions, where eelgrass may exist in small isolated patches, where eelgrass may exhibit high temporal variability, or perhaps where restoration projects could be undertaken. Feature locations may not always be exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. It should be noted that the Potential Eelgrass Beds layer is not a complete dataset of all potential eelgrass sites in Connecticut and/or Long Island Sound. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated. It does not represent current conditions. There are 67 polygon features representing potential eelgrass beds in this layer.

Sample points were taken along Connecticut's coast in Long Island Sound, and in major bays, harbors and rivers along the shoreline. The point features in this layer were compiled from field research using global positioning system (GPS) equipment. Feature locations were not always exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. Some point locations were corrected based on field notes or hydrography and bathymetry conditions at the sample point location. The number of field points that were altered were as follows: In 1993, 32 of 290 points (11%); in 1994, 93 of 454 points (20%); in 1995, 37 of 105 points (35%). Data compilation occurred on 17 days between 7/21/1993 and 11/16/1995; exact dates of each source's data collection are noted in the attribute table. A total of 849 point locations were surveyed. The westernmost point is Frash Pond in Stratford, Connecticut and the easternmost point is the Pawcatuck River on the Connecticut/Rhode Island Border. Eelgrass was found at 484 locations and was described as either high, medium, or low density, or simply as present or absent. Eelgrass was absent at 365 locations. Publication of the datalayer was in 1997. This layer is not updated. This layer does not represent current conditions. Observed Eelgrass Beds is a 1:24,000 scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of observed eelgrass beds in Long Island Sound, in major rivers, and within bays, harbors and other waterbodies along Connecticut's coast. The layer is based on information from the Eelgrass Sample Points layer. It represents conditions at a particular point in time (1993 to 1995). During the 1993-95 field seasons a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology led by Charles Yarish, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), SCUBA, and a 20' boat surveyed over 800 potential eelgrass locations. Their GPS coordinates and field notes were used to create a point coverage entitled Eelgrass Sample Points, which was plotted and checked on a 1:24000 scale base map of the Connecticut shore. These point locations, observations, and the nearshore bathymetry were then used to delineate areas representing both observed and potential eelgrass beds. Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Keeping in mind the temporal and spatial variability of eelgrass, beds may vary in size, shape, and density from year to year. Feature locations may not always be exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. It should be noted that the Observed Eelgrass Beds layer is not a complete dataset of all observed eelgrass sites in Connecticut and/or Long Island Sound.

Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Potential beds, where not individually delineated, were created by buffering observed beds a distance of 33 feet (10 meters). These buffered polygons were intersected with buffered (distance of 5 ft.) shoreline arcs to keep potential polygons a minimum distance off the shoreline. These potential beds are considered to be areas where eelgrass is likely to spread to under ideal conditions, where eelgrass may exist in small isolated patches, where eelgrass may exhibit high temporal variability, or perhaps where restoration projects could be undertaken.

343,Surficial Aquifer Texture,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Surficial Aquifer Texture Map was prepared from the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone, J.R., Schafer, J.P., London, E.H. and Thompson, W.B., 1992, U.S. Geological Survey special map, 2 sheets, scale 1:125,000) to describe unconsolidated areas of the subsurface with similar properties relative to ground water flow. Surficial aquifers are unconsolidated geologic deposits capable of yielding a sufficient quantity of groundwater to wells. Surficial aquifer textures were identified from original surficial materials mapping for use in ground water applications. These are qualitative interpretations of material properties relative to ground water flow. Surficial aquifer texture groups were identified to represent aquifer textures with similar hydraulic conductivities. Some interpretations were made beneath postglacial alluvium and swamp deposits. Alluvium without a subsurface interpretation was classified as having similar hydrologic properties as till. Alluvium areas with subsurface interpretations of fines or coarse grained deposits were classified as having the hydrologic characteristics of the underlying deposits. The aquifer textures include areas of till, fine grained, fine overlying coarse grained, coarse grained, coarse overlying fine grained deposits, artificial fill, beach, salt marsh, swamp, and water. Aquifer texture groups include areas of fine grained , fine overlying coarse grained, coarse grained, and coarse overlying fine grained deposits. Surficial materials not included in the surficial aquifer texture groups include till, artificial fill, beach, salt marsh, swamp, and water. All textural terms follow the grain size classification of Stone et al 1992, modified from Wentworth, 1922. The surficial aquifer texture classifications are suitable for use at 1:24,000 scale. Original mapping of the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut is preserved as polygon attribute values in this data layer, and is herein described. The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. This map was compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. Connecticut Surficial Materials is a 1:24,000-scale, polygon and line feature-based layer describing the unconsolidated glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their grain-size distribution (texture) as compiled at 1:24,000 scale for the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut. Glacial meltwater deposits (stratified deposits) are particularly emphasized because these sediments are the major groundwater aquifers in the State and are also the major source of construction aggregate. These deposits are described in terms of their subsurface distribution of textures as well as their extent. The texture of meltwater deposits through their total vertical thickness in the subsurface is shown to the extent that it is known or can be inferred. In some places only one textural unit (such as SG - Sand and Gravel) describes the whole vertical extent of the meltwater deposits; in other places 'stacked units' (such as SG/S/F - Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines) indicate changes of textural units in the subsurface. Polygon features represent individual textural (surficial material) units with attributes that describe textural unit type and size. Examples of polygon features that are postglacial deposits include floodplain alluvium, swamp deposits, salt-marsh and estuarine deposits, talus, coastal beach and dune deposits, and artificial fill. Examples of glacial ice-laid deposits include till, thin till, thick till and end moraine deposits. Examples of glacial melt-water deposits include gravel, sand and gravel, sand, and very fine sand, silt and clay. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different textural units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale and is not updated. GEOLOGIC DISCUSSION - The following text is excerpted from the text on sheet 1 of the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut, Stone and others, 1992. It has been modified as necessary for use with the 1:24,000 scale digital data, and is not considered a valid substitute for the information found on the published map. For a more complete understanding of the geologic principles behind the Surficial Materials data it is advisable to consult the published map, which contains cross sections, diagrams and text not available in digital form. DISCUSSION OF SURFICIAL MATERIALS - The unconsolidated deposits overlying bedrock in Connecticut range from a few feet to several hundred feet in thickness. These earth materials significantly affect human development of the land. Most of the unconsolidated materials are deposits of continental glaciers that covered all of New England at least twice during the Pleistocene ice age. These glacial deposits are divided into two broad categories, glacial till and glacial stratified deposits. Till, the most widespread glacial deposit, was laid down directly by glacier ice and is characterized by a nonsorted matrix of sand, silt, and clay with variable amounts of stones and large boulders. Glacial meltwater deposits are concentrated in both small and large valleys and were laid down by glacial meltwater in streams and lakes in front of the retreating ice margin during deglaciation. These deposits are characterized by layers of well-sorted to poorly sorted gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Postglacial sediments, primarily floodplain alluvium and swamp deposits, make up a lesser proportion of the unconsolidated materials of Connecticut. Alluvium is largely reworked from glacial materials and has similar physical characteristics. The distribution of surficial (unconsolidated) materials that lie between the land surface (below the pedogenic soil) and the bedrock surface is shown on this map to the extent that it is known or can be inferred. The cross sections and the block diagram shown on the published map (Stone and others, 1992) illustrate the characteristic vertical distribution of glacial till, glacial meltwater deposits, and postglacial deposits encountered in Connecticut. The areal distribution of till and stratified deposits is related to the physiographic regions of the State: the eastern and western highlands and the central lowland. In highland areas, till is the major unconsolidated material, present as a discontinuous mantle of variable thickness over the bedrock surface. Till is thickest in drumlins and on the northwest slopes of hills. Glacial meltwater deposits that average 10-40 feet in thickness overlie the till in small upland valleys and commonly in north-sloping pockets between bedrock hills. In the central lowland, especially in the north half, glacial stratified deposits are the predominant surficial materials. These deposits generally overlie till; however, well logs indicate that in some places till is not present and the stratified deposits lie directly on bedrock. The extensive stratified deposits of the central lowland average 50-100 feet in thickness, and in the northern part they almost completely mask the till-draped bedrock surface. Postglacial materials locally overlie the glacial deposits throughout the State. Alluvium occurs on the floodplains of most streams and rivers. Swamp deposits occur in poorly drained areas. Talus occurs along the bases of steep bedrock cliffs, principally along the traprock ridges within the central lowland. Salt-marsh and estuarine deposits occur mainly along the tidal portions of streams and rivers entering Long Island Sound. Beach deposits occur along the shoreline of Long Island Sound. The units on this map delineate textural changes in the subsurface as well as areally at the surface. An earlier map at 1:125,000 scale of central Connecticut (Stone and others, 1979) shows only surface textural units; a separate map in the same series (Langer, 1979) shows subsurface deposits of fine-grained materials. Several previous 1:24,000-scale quadrangle maps in Connecticut show three-dimensional textural units and refer to them as 'superposed deposits' (see Stone, 1976 and Radway and Schnabel, 1976, as examples). On this map, the term 'stack unit' (Kempton, 1981) is used in place of superposed deposits. DISTRIBUTION OF TEXTURES IN GLACIAL MELTWATER DEPOSITS - The distribution of textural units is extrapolated from both point data (well and test-hole logs, gravel pits, and shovel holes) and from interpretation of landforms based on the principles of morphosequence deposition and systematic northward ice retreat (Koteff, 1974; Koteff and Pessl, 1981). These concepts provide a model by which grain-size distribution can be predicted from the morphology of a deposit, given primary data about the textures at specific points. A morphosequence is a package of sediments deposited contemporaneously by meltwater flowing from the glacier margin to a specific base level. Within a morphosequence, grain size decreases and sorting improves from the ice-marginal (proximal) end of a deposit downstream to the distal end. Landforms are transitional within a sequence as well, ranging from ice-contact forms (eskers, kettles, kames) at the head (proximal end) of a deposit to uncollapsed forms (delta-foreset slopes, lake-bottom plains, valley trains) downstream (distal end). Coarser grained sediments are associated with the proximal parts of morphosequences, finer grained sediments are associated with distal parts; given this principle, textural distribution can be mapped using point data that serve as controls. The relationship between textural variations and morphosequences is illustrated by a cross section on the published map, which shows the distribution of texture units in the northern Quinnipiac River valley. This north-south section transects seven chronologically numbered morphosequences. Dashed lines drawn to the six southern sequences represent the probable generalized surface gradients of the heads of these deposits, prior to collapse (due to melting of buried ice) and subsequent stream entrenchment. From north to south within each of these sequences, the textures grade from coarse- to fine-grained sediments and the topography changes from collapsed to non-collapsed landforms. The longitudinal and vertical relationships illustrated by this section are common in other valleys as well. Stack units similar to those on the section described above occur throughout the stratified deposits of Connecticut. Many deposits having similar superposition of materials of differing texture were produced by geologic processes that occurred repeatedly in time and space during the deglaciation of Connecticut. For example, the SG/S/F and S/F stack units commonly occur in glacial-lake deltas. The SG/F stack unit commonly results from fluvial meltwater (or postglacial stream) terrace deposition on slightly older lake bottom deposits. The F/SG and S/SG units commonly occur in the distal parts of morphosequences where the sand or fines overlap the collapsed, coarser, proximal parts of other (older) sequences. Many basic texture units (G, SG, S, F) likewise have broadly common origins. Units of gravel or sand and gravel often occur in the proximal parts of deposits, or were commonly laid down in glaciofluvial environments. Units of sand and fine-grained sediment are typically associated with distal parts of sequences and were usually laid down in lacustrine environments. THICKNESS OF MATERIALS - The thickness of surficial materials in Connecticut varies considerably because of such factors as the high relief of the bedrock surface, changing conditions of deposition during deglaciation, and various effects of postglacial erosion and removal of glacial sediments. For more information on the thickness of deposits and the point data used to determine stacked units, it is beneficial to review the complete text and figures on the published map. DESCRIPTION OF MAP UNITS GLACIAL ICE-LAID DEPOSITS - Glacial ice-laid deposits (tills) consist of nonsorted, generally nonstratified mixtures of grain-sizes ranging from clay to large boulders. The matrix of most tills is composed dominantly of sand and silt. Boulders within and on the surface of tills range from sparse to abundant. Some tills contain lenses of sorted sand and gravel and, less commonly, masses of laminated fine-grained sediments. The color and lithology of till vary across Connecticut, but generally reflect the composition of the local underlying and northerly adjacent bedrock from which the till was derived. Till blankets the bedrock surface in variable thickness, ranging from 0 to about 200 ft, and commonly underlies stratified meltwater deposits. Tills deposited during two separate glaciations occur in superposition within Connecticut (Pessl and Schafer, 1968). The upper till was deposited during the last (late Wisconsinan) glaciation; it is the most extensive till and is commonly observed in surface exposures, especially in areas where till thickness is less than 15 ft; it is described in the thin till unit description below. The lower till or 'old' till was deposited during an earlier glaciation (probably Illinoian). The lower till has a more patchy distribution; it is principally a subsurface deposit, generally overlain by upper till, and therefore not shown as a separate map unit; the lower till does however constitute the bulk of material in the areas where till thickness is greater than 15 ft; it is described in the thick till unit description below. In all two-till exposures, the base of the upper till truncates the weathered surface of the old till. The lower part of the upper till commonly displays a zone of shearing, dislocation, and brecciation in which clasts of lower till are mixed and incorporated into the upper till. End moraine deposits occur principally in southeastern Connecticut. These deposits were laid down by ablation processes along active ice margins during retreat of the last (late-Wisconsinan) ice sheet. Glacial Ice-Laid deposits include Thin till (T), Thick till (TT), and End moraine deposits (TS). GLACIAL MELTWATER DEPOSITS - Glacial meltwater deposits (stratified deposits) consist of layers of well-sorted to poorly sorted gravel, sand, silt, and clay laid down by flowing meltwater in glacial lakes and streams which occupied the valleys and lowlands of Connecticut during retreat of the last ice sheet. Textural variations within the meltwater deposits occur both areally and vertically because meltwater-flow regimes were different in glaciofluvial (stream), glaciodeltaic (where a stream entered a lake), and glaciolacustrine (lake bottom) depositional environments. Grain-size variations also resulted from meltwater deposition in positions either proximal to or distal from the retreating glacier margin, which was the principal sediment source. A common depositional scenario contained a proximal, ice-marginal meltwater stream in which horizontally bedded glaciofluvial gravel and/or sand and gravel were laid down; farther down valley, the stream entered a glacial lake where glaciodeltaic sediments were deposited consisting of horizontally layered sand and gravel delta-topset beds overlying inclined layers of sand in delta-foreset beds. Farther out in the glacial lake, glaciolacustrine very fine sand, silt, and clay settled out on the lake bottom in flat-lying, thinly bedded layers. Mappable textural variations are present in the vertical section of meltwater deposits in many places. This stacking of textural units commonly resulted from locally changing conditions of meltwater deposition. For example, glacial lakes drained upon ice retreat from particular positions. This may have been followed locally by distal glaciofluvial (stream) deposition from ice positions farther up valley. The resulting vertical section shows meltwater terrace sediments consisting of horizontally bedded fluvial sand and gravel which overlie lake-bottom sediments of very fine sand, silt and clay (shown as unit SG/F on the map). In other places glaciodeltaic deposition over an extended period of time in a particular glacial lake caused deltaic deposits (sand and gravel topset beds over sand foreset beds, unit SG/S) to prograde farther out into the lake and to overlie lake-bottom sediments; such deposits are shown as stack unit SG/S/F on the map. Meltwater deposits are shown on this map as four basic units: gravel, sand and gravel, sand, and fines. Grain-size terminology used to define the textural range within these units is modified from Wentworth, 1922. Stack units are also shown; these are combinations of the four basic units in various orders of superposition. The map units described below show the texture of meltwater deposits through the total vertical section to the extent that it is known or can be reasonably inferred. In some places only one textural unit (such as unit SG) describes the entire vertical thickness of the meltwater deposits. In other places stack units (such as units SG/S/F or S/F) indicate changes of textural units in the subsurface. Common depositional environments for each textural unit are given in parentheses after each unit description. Glacial meltwater deposits are represented by the following categories. Fine deposits include Fines (F). Coarse deposits include Gravel (G), Sand and Gravel (SG), and Sand (S). Stacked Coarse deposits include Gravel overlying Sand and Gravel (G/SG), Gravel overlying Sand (G/S), Sand and Gravel overlying Sand (SG/S), Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Sand and Gravel (SG/S/SG), Sand overlying Gravel (S/G), and Sand overlying Sand and Gravel (S/SG). Stacked Coarse Deposits Overlying Fine deposits include Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines (G/S/F), Gravel overlying Fines (G/F), Sand and Gravel overlying Sand overlying Fines (SG/S/F), Sand and Gravel overlying Fines (SG/F), and Sand overlying Fines (S/F).

The map was compiled from a geospatial analysis of the surficial materials and thickness of glacial sediments digital data layers of the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut, Stone and others (1992) and Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and The Long Island Sound Basin, Stone and others (1998, 2005). The map identifies areas with greater potential for ground water development based upon the texture and thickness of surficial aquifer deposits. The resulting hydrostratigraphic units define areas of coarse grained deposits, coarse overlying fine grained deposits, fine grained deposits, and areas where fine grained deposits overly coarse grained deposits. Aquifer deposit thickness intervals are 1-50 feet, 50-100 feet, 100-200 feet, 200-300 feet, and 300-400 feet. The Surficial Aquifer Potential Map was prepared by the Connecticut Geological Survey at the request of the Water Protection and Land Reuse Bureau of the Department of Environmental Protection. A statewide view of surficial aquifer resources is necessary to facilitate proactive aquifer protection and water supply planning. Previous statewide groundwater availability (Meade 1978) and ground water yields mapping (Mazzaferro 1986) provided excellent planning documents at the time of publication. The compilation presented here incorporates geologic mapping and interpretations of Stone et al (1992; 1998; 2005) unavailable in the earlier treatments. Notably, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone et al 1992), used in this compilation, provides detailed 1:24,000 scale mapping which delineates larger and more numerous areas of coarse-grained deposits than previously known.",Feature Layer,"October 23, 2019","10,843","['aquifer', 'surficial geology', 'geology', 'glacial', 'unconsolidated materials', 'stratified drift', 'Quaternary', 'Geoscience', 'open', 'data', 'surficial', 'potential', 'CT', 'open data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::surficial-aquifer-potential,Environment

The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a re-cut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible when it was originally created.Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006.

Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a re-cut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible when it was originally created.Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network. REC2 can be downloaded or streamed and used directly in ArcMap.

Potential economic loss was based on the value of the land and structures from the county tax parcel database permanently lost in the SLR-XA for each projected sea level rise height. Potential economic loss was analyzed individually for each hazard (passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, or coastal erosion) at the parcel level and subsequently aggregated in 1-hectare (100 square meter or 1,076 square foot) grids. For the islands of Hawaiʻi, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi, the potential economic loss was based solely on passive flooding. Potential economic loss in the SLR-XA area was determined from the highest loss value of any one hazard within the 1-hectare grid, thus avoiding double counting a loss of a particular asset from multiple hazards. Those maximum values for each sector are then summed to determine the total economic loss to property in each grid. Assumptions and Limitations: The vulnerability assessment addressed exposure to chronic flooding with sea level rise. Key assumptions of the economic analysis for the SLR-XA included: (a) loss is permanent; (b) economic loss is based on the value in U.S. dollars in 2016 as property values in the future are unknown; (c) economic loss is based on the value of the land and structures exposed to flooding in the SLR-XA excluding the contents of the property and does not include the economic loss or cost to replace roads, water conveyance systems and other critical infrastructure; and (d) no adaptation measures are put in place that could reduce impacts in the SLR-XA. Economic value data were not available for length of roads, water and wastewater lines, and other public infrastructure due to the variable cost of such infrastructure depending on location, and the complexity and uncertainty involved in design, siting, and construction.

Potential economic loss was based on the value of the land and structures from the county tax parcel database permanently lost in the SLR-XA for each projected sea level rise height. Potential economic loss was analyzed individually for each hazard (passive flooding, annual high wave flooding, or coastal erosion) at the parcel level and subsequently aggregated in 1-hectare (100 square meter or 1,076 square foot) grids. For the islands of Hawaiʻi, Lānaʻi, and Molokaʻi, the potential economic loss was based solely on passive flooding. Potential economic loss in the SLR-XA area was determined from the highest loss value of any one hazard within the 1-hectare grid, thus avoiding double counting a loss of a particular asset from multiple hazards. Those maximum values for each sector are then summed to determine the total economic loss to property in each grid. Assumptions and Limitations: The vulnerability assessment addressed exposure to chronic flooding with sea level rise. Key assumptions of the economic analysis for the SLR-XA included: (a) loss is permanent; (b) economic loss is based on the value in U.S. dollars in 2016 as property values in the future are unknown; (c) economic loss is based on the value of the land and structures exposed to flooding in the SLR-XA excluding the contents of the property and does not include the economic loss or cost to replace roads, water conveyance systems and other critical infrastructure; and (d) no adaptation measures are put in place that could reduce impacts in the SLR-XA. Economic value data were not available for length of roads, water and wastewater lines, and other public infrastructure due to the variable cost of such infrastructure depending on location, and the complexity and uncertainty involved in design, siting, and construction. Additionally, environmental assets such as beaches and wetlands were not assessed economically due to the complexity in valuing ecosystem services. The loss of both public infrastructure and environmental assets from flooding would result in significant economic loss. Therefore, the total potential economic loss figures estimated in the Report and Viewer are likely an underestimate.",Feature Layer,"September 20, 2019","37,411","['sea level rise', 'economic loss', 'coastal and marine', 'global warming', 'economy']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/KauaiGIS::slr-potential-economic-loss-2100,Environment

429,NH Wildlife Action Plan 2020 - Aquatic Habitat (Lakes/Ponds),"New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, Wildlife Division | NHGRANIT","We developed a mapped classification of lakes and ponds based on variables that structure lacustrine natural communities and that could be mapped consistently across Northeastern US. The classification was built upon four key attributes: water temperature, trophic state, alkalinity, and depth. Water temperature was mapped into three classes (very cold, cold, and warm-cool) to reflect the requirements and limits of aquatic organisms. Trophic states, representing the productivity of a lake, were mapped into two classes (oligomesotrophic -mesotrophic and eutrophic- hypereutrophic). Alkalinity was grouped into three classes (high, medium, low) to reflect how well the lake system was buffered from acidification. Depth was divided into two classes (lake, pond) based on a light penetration zone, using maximum depth and trophic state as a proxy for this zone. A steering committee of state and regional experts contributed sampled data with measured values of these and other variables for waterbodies in their states. To create the mapped classification, we compiled the location of every waterbody in the region (n = 36, 675) , and for each waterbody we generatedover 300 descriptive attributes including: morphology, dams, climate, soils, geology, conservation lands, landforms, and land cover in the buffer zone or watershed. We used Random Forest software to develop a predictive model for each classification variable class based on the sampled data points and the descriptive attribute variables, and we then extrapolated the model to the unsampled waterbodies to estimate their class. After estimating each variable class, all waterbodies were assigned to one of 18 classification types based on the combination of 3 variables, temperature + trophic + alkalinity class. These types can be further subdivided into lake or pond categories to yield mapped occurrences, for example: cold, oligo-mesotrophic, low alkalinity, lake. The 18 primary lake and pond types are described in the addition to the “Northeast Terrestrial and Aquatic Habitat Guide”, December 2015.",Feature Layer,"September 1, 2020","15,650","['Environment', 'Conservation', 'Lakes', 'Lacustrine', 'Rivers', 'Riverine', 'Aquatic', 'Habitat Classification', 'Wildlife', 'WAP', 'Wildlife Action Plan', 'NH', 'New Hampshire']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/NHGRANIT::nh-wildlife-action-plan-2020-aquatic-habitat-lakes-ponds,Environment

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.

434,Maine Deer Wintering Areas,Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife | Jason.Czapiga@maine.gov_maine,"This dataset was developed in accordance with Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA).  Under this Act, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) is designated as the authority for determining Significant Wildlife Habitats (SWHs). The polygons mapped in this GIS data set delineate the location of each DWA as accurately as possible given available information at the time they were created; however, consultation with an MDIFW Regional Biologist is strongly advised for a final determination of the boundaries and current habitat quality of any specific area. For any Significant Wildlife Habitat, a field determination by the MDIFW Regional Biologist takes precedence over the mapped polygon.   A deer wintering area (DWA) is defined as a forested area used by deer when snow depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds 12 inches, deer sinking depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds 8 inches and mean daily temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Non-forested wetlands, non-stocked clear-cuts, hardwood types, and stands predominated by eastern larch are included within the DWA only if less than 10 acres in size. Agricultural and development areas within DWAs are excluded regardless of size. Evaluation (rating procedure): Deer wintering areas are evaluated based on three criteria: 1) quality of softwood shelter, 2) intensity of deer use, and 3) size. Information on the quality of softwood shelter and intensity of deer use are based on ground survey plots within the final boundary of the DWA being evaluated. The acreage of the DWA is determined after the final outline of the DWA has been drawn. The final rating of the DWA is determined by summing the scores for the three criteria and assigning a rating as follows: high (score of 10-12), moderate (score of 7-9.9) or low (score of 0-6.9). A regional biologist may recommend a rating change with justification and approval by the management section supervisor. No delisting criteria for regulated Natural Resource Protection Act (NRPA) DWAs have been developed. Currently all DWAs are rated as indeterminate. This dataset includes DWAs in organized townships that qualify as Significant Wildlife Habitat under Maine's Natural Resources Protection Act as mapped by MDIFW Regional Biologists.",Feature Layer,"January 10, 2019","2,170","['Maine', 'MaineIFW', 'MDIFW', 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'biota', 'environment', 'Deer Wintering Areas', 'DWA', 'Natural Resource Protection Act', 'NRPA', 'Significant Wildlife Habitat', 'SWH', 'geolibrary']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::maine-deer-wintering-areas,Environment

441,Maine Wildlife Management Districts Layer,Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife | Jason.Czapiga@maine.gov_maine,"Wildlife Management Districts are delineated, geographical sections of the State that have similarities in biological and geophysical characteristics. Factors such as geographical location (western mountains vs. downeast coastal plain), soils, predominant forest types (northern hardwoods vs. spruce-fir), seasonal temperature variations, precipitation including annual snowfall, land use (northern forest vs. agricultural), and human population and development, etc., are variables that ultimately influence habitat and the abundance and diversity of wildlife. For each WMD, we made a concerted effort to select clearly recognizable physical boundaries to reduce confusion for hunters. Identification of Wildlife Management Districts benefits MDIFW and hunters in several ways. It helps biologists collect and evaluate data and fine-tune management recommendations. Hunters need refer to only one common set of boundaries for all species they pursue. We use all WMDs individually for managing deer. For other game, WMDs are combined, as needed, to form meaningful hunting zones.In 2000, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) undertook an effort to reduce the confusion of having different hunting zones for deer, moose, turkey, and waterfowl by designing a zoning system that met the management requirements for all species, while unifying boundary lines. As a result of that effort, Maine was divided into 30 parcels, and the term Wildlife Management Districts (WMDs) was born. Some of the boundaries of the Wildlife Management Districts were changed in 2006. There are now only 29 districts.In 2014, MDIFW again updated the WMD boundary written descriptions to reflect changes in road names and to correct other errors.

In the Database/Dataset Section the items CMAJOR and CMINOR represent coded pairs and are documented together. Up to five pairs in the pat and four pairs in the aat may be present. These will be appear in the tables as CMAJOR1 CMINOR1 CMAJOR2 CMINOR2, etc. The layer has been provided in both shapefile and coverage format. In the case of the shape file separate shapefiles are provided for point, line, and polygon data. In the coverage format the line and polygon data is combined in one coverage. The shapefiles will be the choice of most users due to speed of drawing issues. Those users desiring to manipulate the original data may want to use the coverage format. All shapefiles have been combined for simplicities sake into one self extracting zip file which expands to about 500 megabytes. However, the value listed in the file size parameter of the metadata represents only the size of the particular shapefile being documented. Also it should be noted that the coverages contain redefined items which of necessity had to be split into separate items in the shapefiles or omitted because this option isn't available in shapefiles.

These monitors are part of various partnership programs including the National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network, the Southeast Saskatchewan Airshed Association (SESAA), the Western Yellowhead Air Management Zone (WYAMZ), and the Great Plains Air Zone (GPAZ). Continuous ambient air monitors measure the concentration of air pollutants across Saskatchewan. The data from these air monitoring locations is used to track and report on progress for achieving air quality objectives; to measure representative pollutant concentrations and determine long-term trends and; to provide air quality information to the public. Air pollutants typically come from various industrial activity and natural sources, such as: mining, oil and gas, agriculture, forest fires, electrical generation, and the transportation sector. Air Quality standards are outlined in Table 20 of the province’s Environmental Code, June 1, 2015 under The Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2010. Additionally, the Air Quality Section of the Ministry of Environment and the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) operate a network of wet deposition monitors in Saskatchewan.

463,New Zealand Marine Environment Classification Feature Layers,National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"The Marine Environment Classification (MEC), a GIS-based environmental classification of the marine environment of the New Zealand region, is an ecosystem-based spatial framework designed for marine management purposes. Developed by NIWA with support from the Ministry for the Environment (MfE), Department of Conservation and Ministry of Fisheries, and with contributions from several other stakeholders, the MEC provides a spatial framework for inventories of marine resources, environmental effects assessments, policy development and design of protected area networks. Two levels of spatial resolution are available within the MEC. A broad scale classification covers the entire EEZ at a nominal spatial resolution of 1 km, whereas the finer scale classification of the Hauraki Gulf region has a nominal spatial resolution of 200 m. Several spatially-explicit data layers describing the physical environment define the MEC. A physically-based classification was chosen because data on these physical variables were available or could be modelled, and because the pattern of the physical environment is a reasonable surrogate for biological pattern, particularly at larger spatial scales. Classes within the classification were defined using multivariate clustering methods. These produce hierarchal classifications that enable the user to delineate environmental variation at different levels of detail and associated spatial scales. Large biological datasets were used to tune the classification, so that the physically-based classes maximised discrimination of variation in biological composition at various levels of classification detail. Thus, the MEC provides a general classification that is relevant to most groups of marine organisms (fishes, invertebrates and chlorophyll) and to ecologically important abiotic variables (e.g., temperature, nutrients).An overview report describing the MEC is available as a PDF file (External Link).

In the NZLRI the maximum erosion severity has been assessed for each LUC unit and this is based on the geology, soil type, steepness, climate and vegetation cover. The land overlays comprise the following LUC units: Land Overlay 1 Classes I-IV and VIe1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 inclusive, Land Overlay 2 Balance of Class VI, Land Overlay 3 (including 3A) Classes VII & VIII (see C7.1.5 for detailed units). Erosion is the natural process of soil and rock wearing away and being moved through the landscape. Erosion includes sheet, wind, creep, slump, flow, rill, earthflow, gully, tunnel gully and stream erosion. In areas undisturbed by human activity, the rate of erosion is determined by geology and weather. Land uses, particularly those that reduce vegetation cover or disturb the soil can lead to a much faster rate of erosion. This is especially heightened in naturally unstable areas where even relatively minor landuse activities can have major impacts. Erosion that has been increased by human action is called induced or accelerated erosion and despite the voluntary erosion control efforts of many landowners and kaitiaki, this remains the major landuse issue in the district that also impacts on the district’s waterways and coastal seabed and key assets such as roading.",Feature Service,"September 21, 2019",,"['Planning', 'Land Management', 'Erosion']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/gizzy::land-management,Environment

508,CPUC Tier 2 (elevated risk) Fire Threat Areas,City of Santa Monica | Zachary.Robinson@SMGOV.NET_smgov,"In 2012, the CPUC ordered the development of a statewide map that is designed specifically for the purpose of identifying areas where there is an increased risk for utility associated wildfires. The development of the CPUC -sponsored fire-threat map, herein ""CPUC Fire-Threat Map,"" started in R.08-11-005 and continued in R.15-05-006. A multistep process was used to develop the statewide CPUC Fire-Threat Map. The first step was to develop Fire Map 1 (FM 1), an agnostic map which depicts areas of California where there is an elevated hazard for the ignition and rapid spread of powerline fires due to strong winds, abundant dry vegetation, and other environmental conditions. These are the environmental conditions associated with the catastrophic powerline fires that burned 334 square miles of Southern California in October 2007. FM 1 was developed by CAL FIRE and adopted by the CPUC in Decision 16-05-036. FM 1 served as the foundation for the development of the final CPUC Fire-Threat Map. The CPUC Fire-Threat Map delineates, in part, the boundaries of a new High Fire-Threat District (HFTD) where utility infrastructure and operations will be subject to stricter fire‑safety regulations. Importantly, the CPUC Fire-Threat Map (1) incorporates the fire hazards associated with historical powerline wildfires besides the October 2007 fires in Southern California (e.g., the Butte Fire that burned 71,000 acres in Amador and Calaveras Counties in September 2015), and (2) ranks fire-threat areas based on the risks that utility-associated wildfires pose to people and property. Primary responsibility for the development of the CPUC Fire-Threat Map was delegated to a group of utility mapping experts known as the Peer Development Panel (PDP), with oversight from a team of independent experts known as the Independent Review Team (IRT). The members of the IRT were selected by CAL FIRE and CAL FIRE served as the Chair of the IRT. The development of CPUC Fire-Threat Map includes input from many stakeholders, including investor-owned and publicly owned electric utilities, communications infrastructure providers, public interest groups, and local public safety agencies. The PDP served a draft statewide CPUC Fire-Threat Map on July 31, 2017, which was subsequently reviewed by the IRT. On October 2 and October 5, 2017, the PDP filed an Initial CPUC Fire-Threat Map that reflected the results of the IRT's review through September 25, 2017. The final IRT-approved CPUC Fire-Threat Map was filed on November 17, 2017. On November 21, 2017, SED filed on behalf of the IRT a summary report detailing the production of the CPUC Fire-Threat Map (referenced at the time as Fire Map 2). Interested parties were provided opportunity to submit alternate maps, written comments on the IRT-approved map and alternate maps (if any), and motions for Evidentiary Hearings. No motions for Evidentiary Hearings or alternate map proposals were received. As such, on January 19, 2018 the CPUC adopted, via Safety and Enforcement Division's (SED) disposition of a Tier 1 Advice Letter, the final CPUC Fire-Threat Map.

510,Quaternary Geology Geologic Basin and Cross Section Set,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Connecticut Quaternary Geology Geologic Basin Divides includes the drainage basins divides appearing on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example). Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples. Connecticut Quaternary Geology Geologic Cross Section includes the cross sections appearing on Sheets 1 and 2 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992).

Combining the textural and vertical stacking information from the Surficial Materials map with the orderly portrayal of morphosequence relationships, up and down valley, that can be gleaned from the Quaternary map provides a three dimensional predictive context for relating the geologic setting of Connecticut's glacial meltwater deposits to their behavior as aquifers and/or transmitters of contaminants. Since this data layer is a polygon and line feature representation of the two maps combined, each map unit's depiction and description could provide information as to its aerial extent, subsurface textural characteristics, depositional and paleogeographic settings, and facies composition in a morphosequence context. Therefore, a typical meltwater polygon would have a combination of Quaternary (e.g. Deposit of Major Sediment-Dammed Lake; Glacial Lake Middletown Cromwell Deltaic Deposit) and Surficial Materials (e.g. sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fine) map attributes. Additional polygon features are incorporated to define surface water areas for streams, lakes, ponds, bays, and estuaries greater than 5 acres in size. Line features describe the type of boundary between individual geologic or textural units such as a geologic contact line between two different geologic units or a linear shoreline feature between a textural unit and an adjacent waterbody. The data have been updated to reflect minor changes in map unit name (QUPOLY_COD) for consistency with the 2005 publication of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin. Previously distributed versions of CTQSGEOM were consistent with the 1998 Open-file Report for the same map. It is important to note that this data layer represents only the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The off-shore geologic units are organized in separate data layers (LISQMOR, LISQFAN, LISQLAKE, LISQCHAN, LISQMARD) which can be used in conjunction with this data layer. These Long Island Sound layers have been mapped at 1:80,000 scale using seismic reflection data. The CTQSGEOM data layer should be used as the geologic base for Connecticut Quaternary Geology / Surficial Materials Features (CTQSFEAT) data layer which represents features such as eskers, meltwater channels, spillways, and locations of radio-carbon dated samples. Connecticut Quaternary Geology Long Island Submerged Marine Lake Deposits identifies lake-bottom and deltaic deposits of Glacial Lake Connecticut submerged in Long Island Sound and Fishers Island Sound. This information appears on Sheet 1 of the The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005). The Connecticut Quaternary Geology digital spatial data combines the information portrayed on the on-land portion of the Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others 2005) with the information portrayed on its sister map, the Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992). When used together, these maps provide a three dimensional context for understanding and predicting the internal composition, resource potential and hydrologic character of Connecticut's glacial and postglacial deposits. Both were compiled at 1:24,000 scale, and published at 1:125,000 scale. The Quaternary Geologic Map of Connecticut and Long Island Sound Basin (Stone and others, 2005) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut (including Long Island Sound) with an emphasis on where and how they were emplaced. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, and deposits of individual end moraines), Early Postglacial Deposits (Late Wisconsinan to Early Holocene stream terrace and inland dune deposits) and Holocene Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. This mapping is based on the concept of systematic northward retreat of the Late Wisconsinan glacier. Meltwater deposits are divided into six depositional system categories (Deposits of Major Ice-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Major Sediment-Dammed Lakes, Deposits of Related Series of Ice-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Related Series of Sediment-Dammed Ponds, Deposits of Proximal Meltwater Streams, and Deposits of Distal Meltwater Streams) based on the arrangement and character of the groupings of sedimentary facies (morphosequences). The Surficial Materials Map of Connecticut (Stone and others, 1992) portrays the glacial and postglacial deposits of Connecticut in terms of their aerial extent and subsurface textural relationships. Glacial Ice-Laid Deposits (thin till, thick till, end moraine deposits) and Postglacial Deposits (alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach deposits, talus, and artificial fill) are differentiated from Glacial Meltwater Deposits. The meltwater deposits are further characterized using four texturally-based map units (g = gravel, sg = sand and gravel, s = sand, and f = fines). In many places a single map unit (e.g. sand) is sufficient to describe the entire meltwater section. Where more complex stratigraphic relationships exist, ""stacked"" map units are used to characterize the subsurface (e.g. sg/s/f - sand and gravel overlying sand overlying fines). Where postglacial deposits overlie meltwater deposits, this relationship is also described (e.g. alluvium overlying sand). Map unit definitions (Surficial Materials Polygon Code definitions, found in the metadata) provide a short description of the inferred depositional environment for each of the glacial meltwater map units. The geologic contacts between till and meltwater deposits coincide on both the Quaternary and Surficial Materials maps, as do the boundaries of polygons that define areas of thick till, alluvium, swamp deposits, marsh deposits, beach and dune deposits, talus, and artificial fill. Within the meltwater deposits, a Quaternary map unit (deposit) may contain several Surficial Materials textural units (akin to facies within a delta, for example).

More recent shellfish classification information may now be available from DA/BA since the time this information was originally published in 2007. The three classification datalayers are feature based. Waterbodies, such as rivers and lakes and ponds, that appear as area features in the hydrography datalayer are classified in the Shellfish Area polygon shapefile. Smaller water bodies, such as streams and creeks, that appear as line features in the hydrography datalayer are classified in the Shellfish Area line shapefile. A separate point shapefile contains the marinas that are classified by DA/BA. Contact DA/BA or local health departments for additional information regarding the classification of marinas and anchorage areas. Three additional datalayers add to the classification picture. Markers, such as buoys, demarcation signs and piers, are referred to in DA/BA text describing the shellfish area classifications.

As defined in C.G.S. 22a-94(b) the coastal boundary is a ""continuous line delineated on the landward side by the interior contour elevation of the one hundred year frequency coastal flood zone, as defined and determined by the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended (USC 42 Section 4101, P.L. 93-234), or a one thousand foot linear setback measured from the mean high water mark in coastal waters, or a one thousand foot linear setback measured from the inland boundary of tidal wetlands mapped under section 22a-20, whichever is farthest inland; and shall be delineated on the seaward side by the seaward extent of the jurisdiction of the state."" The original boundary maps were created in 1979 on stable mylar overlay using the 1:24,000-scale US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps (mylar film format). The source for tidal wetland maps were the legal 1:24,000 maps (mylar format) adopted by the Commissioner of DEP and transformed to 1:24,000 mylar-scale maps by the Office of Policy and Management (OPM) using an accurate pantograph. OPM similarly converted FEMA's flood insurance maps (various scales) to a 1:24,000 mylar overlay. The inland extent of coastal waters was plotted on 1:24,000 USGS topographic maps following the procedures and sources described in The Boundary Between Saltwater and Freshwater in Connecticut, December 1978 prepared by the State of Connecticut, Department of Environmental Protection, Coastal Area Management Program. The following twenty-two towns have adopted municipal coastal boundaries: Chester, Clinton, Darien, Deep River, East Haven, Essex, Fairfield, Greenwich, Groton, Guilford, Hamden, Ledyard, Madison, Milford, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Old Lyme, Old Saybrook, Stamford and Waterford. The coastal boundary maps for these towns may be at different scales than the original DEP draft maps and may contain minor adjustments to the boundary as permitted in C.G.S. 22a-94(f).",Feature Layer,"December 21, 2018",1,"['Coastal Area', 'Connecticut Coastal Management Act', 'Coastal Boundary', 'Long Island Sound', 'Coastal Regulations', 'boundaries', 'Connecticut', 'CT', 'United States of America', 'USA', 'environmental', 'Environmental', 'coastal', 'area', 'open', 'data', 'open data']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CTDEEP::coastal-boundary,Environment
520,Eelgrass Beds 93-95 Set,Department of Energy & Environmental Protection | deepgis,"Eelgrass Beds 93-95 Set: Eelgrass Sample Points is a 1:24,000-scale, point feature-based layer that depicts the locations where eelgrass (Zostera marina) was either observed or where a location would be potentially favorable for future eelgrass growth. Sample points were taken along Connecticut's coast in Long Island Sound, and in major bays, harbors and rivers along the shoreline. The point features in this layer were compiled from field research using global positioning system (GPS) equipment. Feature locations were not always exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. Some point locations were corrected based on field notes or hydrography and bathymetry conditions at the sample point location. The number of field points that were altered were as follows: In 1993, 32 of 290 points (11%); in 1994, 93 of 454 points (20%); in 1995, 37 of 105 points (35%). Data compilation occurred on 17 days between 7/21/1993 and 11/16/1995; exact dates of each source's data collection are noted in the attribute table. A total of 849 point locations were surveyed. The westernmost point is Frash Pond in Stratford, Connecticut and the easternmost point is the Pawcatuck River on the Connecticut/Rhode Island Border. Eelgrass was found at 484 locations and was described as either high, medium, or low density, or simply as present or absent. Eelgrass was absent at 365 locations. Publication of the datalayer was in 1997. This layer is not updated. This layer does not represent current conditions. Observed Eelgrass Beds is a 1:24,000 scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of observed eelgrass beds in Long Island Sound, in major rivers, and within bays, harbors and other waterbodies along Connecticut's coast. The layer is based on information from the Eelgrass Sample Points layer. It represents conditions at a particular point in time (1993 to 1995). During the 1993-95 field seasons a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology led by Charles Yarish, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), SCUBA, and a 20' boat surveyed over 800 potential eelgrass locations. Their GPS coordinates and field notes were used to create a point coverage entitled Eelgrass Sample Points, which was plotted and checked on a 1:24000 scale base map of the Connecticut shore. These point locations, observations, and the nearshore bathymetry were then used to delineate areas representing both observed and potential eelgrass beds. Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Keeping in mind the temporal and spatial variability of eelgrass, beds may vary in size, shape, and density from year to year. Feature locations may not always be exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. It should be noted that the Observed Eelgrass Beds layer is not a complete dataset of all observed eelgrass sites in Connecticut and/or Long Island Sound. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated. It does not represent current conditions. There are 101 polygon features representing observed eelgrass beds in this layer. Geographic locations are as follows: westernmost areas: Clinton Harbor; easternmost areas: Little Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island waters. Observed beds range in size from .003 acre (131 sq. ft.) to 49 acres (2,136,608 sq. ft.). The total area of observed beds is 632.6 acres. Potential Eelgrass Beds is a 1:24,000 scale, polygon feature-based layer that depicts the locations of potential eelgrass beds in Long Island Sound, in major rivers, and within bays, harbors and other waterbodies along Connecticut's coast. The layer is based on information from the Observed Eelgrass Beds and Eelgrass Sample Points layers. It represents conditions at a particular point in time (1993 to 1995). During the 1993-95 field seasons a team of researchers from the University of Connecticut Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology led by Charles Yarish, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS), SCUBA, and a 20' boat surveyed over 800 potential eelgrass locations. Their GPS coordinates and field notes were used to create a point coverage entitled Eelgrass Sample Points, which was plotted and checked on a 1:24000 scale base map of the Connecticut shore. These point locations, observations, and the nearshore bathymetry were then used to delineate areas representing both observed and potential eelgrass beds. Eelgrass beds were initially digitized at 1:24,000 scale, but have been edited and revised on screen at higher resolution. Potential beds, where not individually delineated, were created by buffering observed beds a distance of 33 feet (10 meters). These buffered polygons were intersected with buffered (distance of 5 ft.) shoreline arcs to keep potential polygons a minimum distance off the shoreline. These potential beds are considered to be areas where eelgrass is likely to spread to under ideal conditions, where eelgrass may exist in small isolated patches, where eelgrass may exhibit high temporal variability, or perhaps where restoration projects could be undertaken. Feature locations may not always be exact due to equipment failure or lack of satellite reception. In those cases, points were estimated from field notes. It should be noted that the Potential Eelgrass Beds layer is not a complete dataset of all potential eelgrass sites in Connecticut and/or Long Island Sound. This layer was published in 1997 and is not updated. It does not represent current conditions. There are 67 polygon features representing potential eelgrass beds in this layer. Geographic locations are as follows: westernmost areas: Clinton Harbor; easternmost areas: Little Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island waters. Potential beds range in size from .179 acre (318 sq. ft.) to 471 acres (20,551,582 sq. ft.). Potential beds contain 0 to 9 observed beds, and from 0 to 88.1% area covered by observed beds.

The concentration areas are primarily found along the shoreline and the lower tributaries and wetlands of major Connecticut rivers. In addition to depicting the concentration areas, the potential waterfowl species associated with each polygon have been identified and are listed in the attribute table as boolean values indicating their presence or absence. The intent of this datalayer is to assist in the identification of migratory waterfowl resource areas in the event of an oil spill or other condition that might be a threat to waterfowl species.

It also includes several points located along the north shore of Long Island. There are a total of 131 point features, the majority of which are located east of the Connecticut River. Point features in this layer are compiled from two major sources: 1) the polygon feature label points in the Historic Eelgrass Beds polygon layer representing sources with a mapping component; and 2) additional points that were based on historic literature review that had no mapping component. Source information including source description and collection date for each point is described in the layer's table data. Feature locations are inexact.

Key drivers behind the reductions since 2006 were an increasingly cleaner electric grid, reduced energy use intensity per square foot of building space, and increased vehicle fuel economy. Similarly, greenhouse gases associated with District Government operations fell 24% since 2006 and 9% since 2013, for a total of 519,636 metric tons in 2016. These reductions were driven by lower emissions from buildings and facilities, partly due to the cleaner regional electric grid.

Further, NISIMS was chosen due to its potential for standardizing exotic plant data management across DOI agencies.",Feature Service,"September 9, 2020",,"['GRSM', 'EXOTICS', 'Weeds', 'Invasive']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/nps::grsm-exotics,Environment

Continuous ambient air monitors measure the concentration of air pollutants across Saskatchewan. The data from these air monitoring locations is used to track and report on progress for achieving air quality objectives; to measure representative pollutant concentrations and determine long-term trends and; to provide air quality information to the public. Air pollutants typically come from various industrial activity and natural sources, such as: mining, oil and gas, agriculture, forest fires, electrical generation, and the transportation sector. Air Quality standards are outlined in Table 20 of the province’s Environmental Code, June 1, 2015 under The Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2010. Additionally, the Air Quality Section of the Ministry of Environment and the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) operate a network of wet deposition monitors in Saskatchewan.

The contaminated sites within the Gisborne district are identified on the Urban and Rural planning maps and listed in Appendix 15. Identification of sites in the Gisborne district which are contaminated is an ongoing exercise. Additional sites which are verified as contaminated sites will be identified as such through a plan change process. Contaminated sites are those sites where hazardous substances occur at concentrations above background levels and where assessment indicates it poses or could potentially pose an immediate or long-term hazard to human health or to the environment. Contaminated sites may cause actual or potential harm to human health or the environment when the contaminant on the site becomes exposed to an organism or natural or physical resource which is sensitive to the adverse effects of the contaminant.

Continuous ambient air monitors measure the concentration of air pollutants across Saskatchewan. The data from these air monitoring locations is used to track and report on progress for achieving air quality objectives; to measure representative pollutant concentrations and determine long-term trends and; to provide air quality information to the public. Air pollutants typically come from various industrial activity and natural sources, such as: mining, oil and gas, agriculture, forest fires, electrical generation, and the transportation sector. Air Quality standards are outlined in Table 20 of the province’s Environmental Code, June 1, 2015 under The Environmental Management and Protection Act, 2010. Additionally, the Air Quality Section of the Ministry of Environment and the Canadian Air and Precipitation Monitoring Network (CAPMoN) operate a network of wet deposition monitors in Saskatchewan.

Along with other plants, eelgrass forms the base of food production in the sea. Eelgrass provides shelter for juvenile fish, and invertebrates, is a site for primary settlement of the larvae of some bivalve mollusks, and in certain locations helps to stabilize unconsolidated sediments and shorelines. In June 2018, Casco Bay was flown and photographed. Photography was timed near low tides with low wind velocity, good water clarity, and maximum biomass of eelgrass. These factors aid in the detection of the subtidal portion of a bed. Polygons delineating stands of eelgrass were screen digitized and coded using a four category scale of percent cover. Cover Class values: 1 = 0% to 10% cover, 2 = 10% to 40% cover, 3 = 40% to 70% cover, 4 = 70% to 100% cover. Verification was carried out by boat, on foot, and by plane. Though dense patches of eelgrass approximately 6 meters in diameter and less can be identified under good conditions and in some cases were mapped, a conservative estimate of the minimum mapping unit is 150 square meters. This represents a stand of approximately 14 meters in diameter.",Feature Layer,"December 16, 2019",956,"['MaineDEP', 'biota', 'dep', 'environment', 'eelgrass', 'Maine DEP', 'Maine Department of Environmental Protection', 'state of maine', 'BIOLOGY', 'coastal', 'submerged aquatic vegetation', 'Zostera marina', 'oceans', 'habitat', 'Maine', 'GeoLibrary']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedep-eelgrass-2018-casco-bay-only,Environment

786,MaineDEP Eelgrass 2013 (Casco Bay Only),Maine Department of Environmental Protection | John.Lynam@maine.gov_maine,"Maine's eelgrass meadows form an important marine and estuarine coastal aquatic habitat for the state. Along with other plants, eelgrass forms the base of food production in the sea. Eelgrass provides shelter for juvenile fish, and invertebrates, is a site for primary settlement of the larvae of some bivalve mollusks, and in certain locations helps to stabilize unconsolidated sediments and shorelines. In August 2013, Casco Bay was flown and photographed. Photography was timed near low tides with low wind velocity, good water clarity, and maximum biomass of eelgrass. These factors aid in the detection of the subtidal portion a bed. Polygons delineating stands of eelgrass were screen digitized and coded using a four category scale of percent cover. Cover Class values: 1 = 0% to 10% cover, 2 = 10% to 40% cover, 3 = 40% to 70% cover, 4 = 70% to 100% cover. Verification was carried out by boat, on foot, and by plane. Though dense patches of eelgrass approximately 6 meters in diameter and less can be identified under good conditions and in some cases were mapped, a conservative estimate of the minimum mapping unit is 150 square meters. This represents a stand of approximately 14 meters in diameter.",Feature Layer,"August 17, 2020","1,056","['MaineDEP', 'biota', 'dep', 'eelgrass', 'environment', 'Maine DEP', 'Maine Department of Environmental Protection', 'state of maine', 'BIOLOGY', 'coastal', 'submerged aquatic vegetation', 'Zostera marina', 'oceans', 'habitat', 'Maine', 'GeoLibrary']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedep-eelgrass-2013-casco-bay-only,Environment

908,August / Août,cgp_aafc,"This layer represents areas where primary production is considered to be high. Primary production includes microscopic algal blooms, named phytoplankton, a food resource at the base of the food web of marine ecosystems. The knowledge of these zones can serve as a proxy to identify areas of the St. Lawrence where productivity is higher at different times of the year. Impacting his component may influence the rest of the life cycle in the affected area. Data were generated from the Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) developed by Dr. Diane Lavoie. This model makes it possible to calculate, using 10 variables, the primary production in each cell of the grid of the model. This calculation was done at a monthly resolution and a threshold was then applied to the data to keep only those cells where the estimated concentrations exceeded 20 mg C / m-2. This level of primary production is considered high. Additional Information Monthly mean primary production (mg C m-2) in the first 50 meters of the simulated surface with the three-dimensional CANOPA-GSBM numerical model over a period of 13 years (1998-2010). The Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) simulates biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, and the biological components that determine the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem. The model has 10 state variables. The NPZD (nutrients, primary production, zooplankton, detritus) model includes both simplified herbivorous and microbial food chains typical of bloom and post-bloom conditions. The export of biogenic matter at depth is mediated by the herbivorous food web (nitrate, large phytoplankton (diatoms), mesozooplankton, particulate organic matter), while the microbial food web (ammonium, small phytoplankton, microzooplankton, dissolved organic matter) is mainly responsible for nutrient recycling in the euphotic zone. Nitrate is also supplied by rivers. The tight coupling between small phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing, autochtonous nitrogen release and (dissolved organic nitrogen) DON remineralization to ammonium (NH4+) is used to represent the dynamic of the microbial food chain. Biological transfer functions are derived from bulk formulations using mean parameters found in the literature. Biological variables are calculated in nitrogen units and algal biomass and production converted to Chl a and carbon units using fixed stoichiometric ratios. Detrital particulate organic nitrogen (PON) gets fragmented to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as it sinks toward the bottom. The phytoplankton growth rate is a function of light and nutrient availability. The available light for phytoplankton growth is a function of sea-ice cover, Chl a and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The GSBM biogeochemical model, coupled with the CANOPA regional circulation model, was used to produce the Chl a layer. The grid of the model is 1/12° horizontally (about 6 x 8 km), 46 layers vertical and covers the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine regions. The vertical resolution is variable (between 6 m close to the surface to 90 m at depths of about 500 m). This model includes tidal forcing and the freshwater supply of the St. Lawrence River and the many rivers in the region, as well as atmospheric forcing (temperature, wind, etc.) produced by an independent model (National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2). In addition, the circulation model is coupled with a model of sea ice that reproduces the seasonality of the ice cover in the region. The temperature and salinity fields are produced freely by the model and only constrained by monthly climatologies of these conditions at the boundaries of the model domain. The simulation was carried out over a part of the period covering the Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) from 1998 to 2010.

The grid of the model is 1/12° horizontally (about 6 x 8 km), 46 layers vertical and covers the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine regions. The vertical resolution is variable (between 6 m close to the surface to 90 m at depths of about 500 m). This model includes tidal forcing and the freshwater supply of the St. Lawrence River and the many rivers in the region, as well as atmospheric forcing (temperature, wind, etc.) produced by an independent model (National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2). In addition, the circulation model is coupled with a model of sea ice that reproduces the seasonality of the ice cover in the region. The temperature and salinity fields are produced freely by the model and only constrained by monthly climatologies of these conditions at the boundaries of the model domain. The simulation was carried out over a part of the period covering the Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) from 1998 to 2010.

910,July / Juillet,cgp_aafc,"This layer represents areas where primary production is considered to be high. Primary production includes microscopic algal blooms, named phytoplankton, a food resource at the base of the food web of marine ecosystems. The knowledge of these zones can serve as a proxy to identify areas of the St. Lawrence where productivity is higher at different times of the year. Impacting his component may influence the rest of the life cycle in the affected area. Data were generated from the Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) developed by Dr. Diane Lavoie. This model makes it possible to calculate, using 10 variables, the primary production in each cell of the grid of the model. This calculation was done at a monthly resolution and a threshold was then applied to the data to keep only those cells where the estimated concentrations exceeded 20 mg C / m-2. This level of primary production is considered high. Additional Information Monthly mean primary production (mg C m-2) in the first 50 meters of the simulated surface with the three-dimensional CANOPA-GSBM numerical model over a period of 13 years (1998-2010). The Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) simulates biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, and the biological components that determine the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem. The model has 10 state variables. The NPZD (nutrients, primary production, zooplankton, detritus) model includes both simplified herbivorous and microbial food chains typical of bloom and post-bloom conditions. The export of biogenic matter at depth is mediated by the herbivorous food web (nitrate, large phytoplankton (diatoms), mesozooplankton, particulate organic matter), while the microbial food web (ammonium, small phytoplankton, microzooplankton, dissolved organic matter) is mainly responsible for nutrient recycling in the euphotic zone. Nitrate is also supplied by rivers. The tight coupling between small phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing, autochtonous nitrogen release and (dissolved organic nitrogen) DON remineralization to ammonium (NH4+) is used to represent the dynamic of the microbial food chain. Biological transfer functions are derived from bulk formulations using mean parameters found in the literature. Biological variables are calculated in nitrogen units and algal biomass and production converted to Chl a and carbon units using fixed stoichiometric ratios. Detrital particulate organic nitrogen (PON) gets fragmented to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as it sinks toward the bottom. The phytoplankton growth rate is a function of light and nutrient availability.

Each point gives the number of years of high aggregation probability (6 to 10 years). The data were produced from a mathematical model developed in Plourde et al. 2016. The model has allowed to calculate the probability of meeting a strong aggregation of krill over a period of 10 years. High krill aggregations are defined as the 95th percentile of predicted biomass in 10 x 10 km cells covering the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Additional Information Plourde, S., Lehoux, C., McQuinn, I.H., and Lesage, V. (2016). Describing krill distribution in the western North Atlantic using statistical habitat models. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2016/nnn. vi + xx p. Plourde, S., McQuinn, I.H., Lesage, V., Lehoux, C., Joly, P., Bourassa, M-N. in prep. Spatial distribution of krill in eastern Canadian waters: a climatological approach based on historical plankton net and acoustic data. The data are incomplete upstream of Pointe-des-Monts because of the lack of water height anomalies in the area (variable being used to predict aggregations of krill). A less number of years with a high aggregation of krill is thus represented but that should not be interpreted as a less favorable zone compared to areas East of Pointe-des-Monts.

The distribution area of each group has been evaluated using five criteria in order to determine the EBSA (DFO, 2004): 1. Uniqueness: Ranked from areas whose characteristics are unique, rare, distinct, and for which alternatives do not exist to areas whose characteristics are widespread with many areas which are similar. 2. Aggregation: Ranked from areas where most individuals of a species are aggregated to areas where individuals of the species are widespread 3. Fitness consequence: Ranked from areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make a major contribution to the fitness of the population or species present to areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make only marginal contributions to fitness. 4. Resilience: Ranked from areas where the habitat structures or species are highly sensitive, easily perturbed, and slow to recover to areas where the habitat structures or species are robust, resistant to perturbation, or readily return to the pre-perturbation state. 5. Naturalness: Ranked from areas which are pristine and characterized by native species to areas which are highly perturbed by anthropogenic activities and/or with high abundances of introduced or cultured species.

942,"Air pollutant emissions - Ammonia emissions by facility, Canada",cgp_aafc,"The Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators (CESI) program provides data and information to track Canada's performance on key environmental sustainability issues. The Air pollutant emissions indicators track emissions from human activities of 6 key air pollutants: sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. Black carbon, which is a component of fine particulate matter, is also reported. Sectoral indicators on air pollutant emissions from transportation, off-road vehicles and mobile equipment, electric utilities and the oil and gas industry provide additional analysis on the largest sources of Canada's air pollutant emissions. For each air pollutant, the indicators are provided at the national and provincial/territorial levels. They also identify the major sources of emissions and provide links to detailed information on air pollutant emissions from facilities. The Air pollutant emissions indicators are intended to inform Canadians and decision makers about progress made towards reducing emissions from human-related sources of air pollutants and about the effectiveness of emission reduction measures implemented to improve ambient air quality in Canada.

948,"Important areas of Blue Whale feeding, foraging and migration in eastern Canada",cgp_aafc,"The distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) is mainly dictated by key environmental drivers such as food requirements and availability, sea ice, and sometimes predation risks. It is common to find blue whales in upwelling regions, depending on topography (banks, slopes and shallow water) and thermal fronts, which are actually related to krill aggregations. Blue whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill) and have the highest absolute metabolic demands. A shapefile on the distribution of significant perennial areas of krill aggregation is available (DFO-ECCC). Important habitats for blue whales have therefore been identified by combining information on their distribution with krill aggregation areas (observed or predicted). In the waters of the St. Lawrence estuary, the presence of blue whales for foraging, feeding and migration has been observed throughout the year, with increased activity during the summer. It has been observed that feeding rates of blue whales are higher in shallow waters and during nocturnal periods (krill at surface), confirming that foraging near the surface is beneficial when possible. Their presence, their great fidelity to this important habitat for their activities and their behavior in the waters of the St. Lawrence in all seasons, show that blue whales are vulnerable to oil spills. They are vulnerable, not only indirectly through the reduction of prey and loss of suitable habitat, but also by their behavior requiring active activity on the surface and near the coast.. Additional Information The data used to create the polygons using the bounding box method comes from multiple sources of information: hunting records, photo-identification, coastal, airborne and boat surveys, passive acoustic monitoring, radio and satellite telemetry , ice trapping, anecdotal observations and modeling.

Catch and effort data were aggregated by 100 km² cells. The probability of catching an Atlantic Wolffish in a set and within a cell (relative occurrence) was calculated as the ratio of the number of sets in which a species was recorded and the total number of sets made. This method allows the mapping of catch and effort for numerous time series based on data from different programs in both the whole study area (research surveys and Sentinel Fisheries using bottom trawls and a random stratified design) or in specific areas within the Gulf.

963,2019 Anomaly/Anomalie en 2019,cgp_aafc,"Gridded temperature and salinity of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence bottom waters including shallow waters. Data are a result of a 3D interpolation on a 1km x 1km x bottom depth grid. They mostly come from the 2 multidisciplinary surveys but all the available CTD data sampled in August and September were used. The dataset contains 24 layers: one layer per year per variable from 2010 to 2019, two layers of temperature and salinity climatologies and two layers of 2019 anomalies. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

967,Known and exploited scallop beds in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence,cgp_aafc,"Iceland and sea Scallops (Chlamys islandica and Placopecten magellanicus) represent an important biological resource for commercial fisheries and coastal ecology. The beds of this layer are described as being known and commercially exploited historically and / or currently, and have undergone validation and delimitation treatment with a good degree of precision. They are located in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the North Shore, Anticosti, the North Shore of Gaspésie and the Magdalen Islands. The beds are considered among the most abundant beds of scallops used for commercial fishing (noteworthy: high densities and fishing activity do not strictly stick to these beds). They are known to be vulnerable mainly during the larval growth period from August to November for larval survival, but remain vulnerable all year long, being sessile species. The data layer contains information on the total area of the beds, the fishing zones and fishery bottoms (validation step in lineage), the name of the beds and the breeding periods and fishing periods (valid in 2015) by sector. Additional Information The scallop beds in this data layer have been determined from these three sources of information: research surveys (since 1977, annual alternating sectors since 2009), exploratory fisheries (2000, 2001, 2003) and commercial fisheries (annual). The beds in this layer have a higher degree of precision within the known fishing zones and bottoms in the Côte-Nord and Anticosti sectors, Gaspésie and the Magdalen Islands . They represent the important beds known and exploited historically. They do not represent the general distribution of the species, do not take into account the large unexploited beds of scallops or exploited beds whose delimitation work has not yet been specified. It is the most precise up-to-date data. Sea and Iceland scallops are found mainly at shallow depths in the coastal environment (from 20 to 80 m depending on the area) on gravel, shells or rocks. The deposits are usually associated with the presence of larval retention zones, and are vulnerable during the larval growth period (5 weeks) between August and November.

The Air pollutant emissions indicators track emissions from human activities of 6 key air pollutants: sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. Black carbon, which is a component of fine particulate matter, is also reported. Sectoral indicators on air pollutant emissions from transportation, off-road vehicles and mobile equipment, electric utilities and the oil and gas industry provide additional analysis on the largest sources of Canada's air pollutant emissions. For each air pollutant, the indicators are provided at the national and provincial/territorial levels. They also identify the major sources of emissions and provide links to detailed information on air pollutant emissions from facilities. The Air pollutant emissions indicators are intended to inform Canadians and decision makers about progress made towards reducing emissions from human-related sources of air pollutants and about the effectiveness of emission reduction measures implemented to improve ambient air quality in Canada. Information is provided to Canadians in a number of formats including: static and interactive maps, charts and graphs, HTML and CSV data tables and downloadable reports.

Of the 763 references identified, 14 involved diluted bitumen and other heavy crude oils, indicating the need for further research of these products in the marine environment. Diluent research suggests relatively fast evaporation and dispersion times for this component, however high toxicities may pose a threat to marine biota. Historical studies indicate older dispersant formulations had potential ecological implications, therefore newer formulations, which have not been studied in detail, require full assessment. Consistent utilization of toxicology standards remains elusive, hindering species sensitivity analyses. Exxon Valdez literature demonstrates highly variable impacts from a single oil type and the need for baseline data, recovery status, and suitable ecological end-point determination.

977,Roseate Tern (Sterna dougallii) - Critical Habitat for Species at Risk - Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia),cgp_aafc,"This dataset displays the geographic areas within which critical habitat for terrestrial species at risk, listed on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), occurs in Atlantic Canada: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Note that this includes only terrestrial species and species for which Environment and Climate Change Canada is the lead. However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with the information provided in a species' recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (""biophysical attributes"") that complete the definition of a species' critical habitat. Each species' dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data for all terrestrial species in Atlantic Canada that is available for download. The collection includes critical habitat as it is depicted in final recovery documents. It is important to note that recovery documents, and therefore critical habitat, may be amended from time to time. Also, new species can be added to Schedule 1 of SARA and thus new critical habitat described when additional recovery documents are posted on the SAR Public Registry. As critical habitat is amended, this dataset will be updated; however the SAR Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca) should always be considered the definitive source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. some turtle species), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as ""grid squares"". These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species' recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. Critical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species"". Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic ""protection"" designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection.

Of the 933 lakes, 244 (or 26%) are considered acid sensitive, almost always because of naturally low calcium and magnesium (or ""base cation"") concentrations. The most acid-sensitive lakes (i.e., those with extremely low base cation concentrations) are located on the Canadian Shield in both Alberta and Saskatchewan and east of the oils sands development area. Fifty-one of the 244 acid-sensitive lakes were sampled twice annually (spring and fall) to identify chemical changes through trend analyses. Results revealed that 55% of these lakes had concentrations of some metals in excess of Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment guidelines. Of the 291 samples taken in the 51 lakes, iron concentrations were greater than guidelines in 36% (105 samples), aluminum in 33% (97 samples), lead in 0.3% (1 sample) and copper in 0.3% (1 sample). The metals in these lakes occur naturally and are expected to be found in a wide range of concentrations given the geology and physiography of the Canadian Shield. It remains to establish the relationship between acid sensitivity, geology and high metal concentrations.

988,Copper Redhorse critical habitat in Quebec,cgp_aafc,"The Copper Redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) is the only fish whose distribution is exclusively restricted to Quebec. This range is restricted even further to the St. Lawrence River and some of its tributaries. This layer represents the Copper Redhorse critical habitat defined by the analysis of available knowledge and a scientific advice. Purpose The Copper Redhorse population is in decline due to several threats like habitat degradation, construction of dams, contaminants, exotic or introduced species, recreational activities, commercial fishery, and low water levels. Furthermore, certain biological characteristics of the Copper Redhorse contribute to its vulnerability. The Copper Redhorse population was officialy listed as endangered in Schedule I of the Species at Risk Act in December 2007. Additional Information Critical habitat for the Copper Redhorse has been identified to the extent possible, based on the best available information. Two workshops held in 2009 and 2010 by Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune du Québec, allowed to review the information and take note of the new data to identify habitat use by the Copper Redhorse in the St. Lawrence and Richelieu rivers and later in the Rivière des Prairies and Rivière des Milles Îles. Adult feeding habitat in the St. Lawrence River between Lake Saint-Louis and Lake Saint-Pierre, was identified using modeling based on the telemetric monitoring of habitat use and on twelve habitat variables (for example: depth, current velocity, vegetation density). Also, recent telemetry and historic data confirmed the use of the lower stretches of the Rivière des Prairies and Rivière des Mille Îles. Critical adult feeding habitat is consequently identified as habitat in the fluvial reach between Montreal and Sorel presenting favorable characteristics for the copper redhorse, used in the model.

990,Phytoplankton counts and oceanographic conditions at the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) stations,cgp_aafc,"Phytoplankton species abundance (cell/L) and oceanographic conditions (temperature, salinity, chlorophylle-a (mg/m³) for some years and nutrient content (mmol/m³)) at stations of the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) from1994 to 2016. The layer presents the station positions of the HAMP. Two files are attached to each station: one containing the cell counts and the second the oceanographic conditions. Purpose The summer growth of many toxic and harmful microalgae species poses a serious threat for the public health and commercial or recreational exploitation of some marine species. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) initiated the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) in 1989 in order to complete the monitoring program for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Under the responsibility of Maurice-Lamontagne Institute scientists, the HAMP is to monitor, by means of a coastal station network, the natural occurrence of toxic and harmful algae in the St. Lawrence in order to determine their spatio-temporal distribution and the environmental conditions leading to their bloom. The network is made up of 11 coastal stations which are sampled every week from April to November and which are established along Quebec eastern shores. It extends from Tadoussac to Tête-à-la-Baleine on the St. Lawrence north shore and from Sainte-Flavie to Carleton on the south shore along the Gaspé peninsula. Another station is located in Havre-Aux-Maisons, Magdalen Islands. The HAMP was discontinued in 2010 but opportunistic samplings are still done at some stations. Additional information The sampling and analysis protocol is described in details in the following publication apart from the fact that the number of identified and counted species significantly has been increasing with time.

991,Southern British Columbia Chinook Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013.

994,Great Lakes Migrant Waterfowl Survey,cgp_aafc,"The Great Lakes Migrant Waterfowl Surveys provide periodic data on waterfowl abundance, spatial and temporal distributions, and use along the shorelines of major water bodies and river systems in Ontario during mostly during spring and fall, and to a lesser extent during summer and winter, seasons. The primary survey area covers the shoreline and nearshore (~1km) waters of the Lower Great Lakes region of Ontario, specifically including the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, Niagara River, Lake Erie, Detroit River and Lake St. Clair and associated major marshes and embayments. Aerial surveys, typically flown several times within spring (March -May: 1969, 1971, 1972, 1975 -1979, 1981, 1982, 1984 -1988, 1991 -1996, 1998 -2003 & 2009 -2011) and fall (September -December: 1968, 1970, 1971, 1974 -2003 & 2009 -2011) survey periods, have been conducted periodically on a relatively regular basis (approx. 5-10 years) along the Lower Great Lakes shorelines between 1968 and 2011. Smaller-scale surveys also have been conducted periodically during summer (June -August: 1968 -1970, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1982, 1984, 1986, 1989, 1999 & 2002) in this region. This survey often has been conducted in conjunction with the Midwinter Survey, so its data (up to 2004) also are included in the CWS Migrant Waterfowl Surveys database (Year ≥2004 & Month = January & February).Data from several aerial surveys conducted periodically during the non-breeding period outside the Lower Great Lakes region also are included in this database. Spring and fall surveys have been conducted along the shorelines and nearshore waters of the Upper Great Lakes region of Ontario, specifically at St. Clair River (Fall 2012 & 2013), Lake Huron (Fall 1973, 1996; Spring 1974) / Georgian Bay (Fall 1973, 1996, 2012 & 2013) & Lake Superior (Fall 2000).

Due to the lack of information, studies are planned in the near future to increase knowledge of the species. Critical habitat actual limitations could change someday. Purpose The beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population in the St. Lawrence Estuary was greatly reduced by hunting, which was finally banned in the St. Lawrence in 1979. In May 2005, this beluga population was officially listed as a threatened species on SARA's List of Wildlife Species at Risk. Additional Information St. Lawrence beluga critical habitat is identified using the best available information. All the available information on its prey, seasonal distribution, use and characteristics of its habitat has been reviewed by Mosnier (2010). This literature review was used to produce a science advisory report reviewed by marine mammal experts. Beluga whale critical habitat has been identified with the information and the scientific advice, using the area of occupancy approach and corresponds to the summer distribution of groups made up of adults and new-born calves and juveniles.

998,Known and exploited Stimpson's surfclam beds in Quebec coastal waters,cgp_aafc,"Stimpson's surfclam is under protection and conservation measures to protect its reproductive potential and the integrity of the population (beds) in the Quebec region. The beds of this layer are described as being known and commercially exploited historically and / or currently and have undergone validation and delineation processing with a good degree of precision. They are located in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the North Shore and the Magdalen Islands. The beds of this layer are considered among the most abundant in Stimpson's surfclams and used for commercial fishing (note: the high densities are not strictly found in these beds). They are mainly recognized as vulnerable during the breeding season from June to July. There may be secondary spawning in the fall as well. The data layer contains information on the total area each bed's polygon, the areas and names of the beds, the target sectors, and the breeding and fishing periods. Additional Information Exploratory fishing for Stimpson's surfclam began in 1990 in the Magdalen Islands and in 1991 on the North Shore of Quebec. Since 1993, commercial fishing activity has steadily increased and yielded up to 785 tons of Stimpson's surfclam in Quebec (2014). Stimpson's surfclam is a sessile bivalve mollusc and a strong burrower in sandy sediments in the subtidal zone. Maximum densities are found between 15-20 m on the North Shore and between 25-60 m in the Magdalen Islands. The surfclam has a long lifetime, slow growth rate and therefore, low productivity. A sedentary lifestyle, irregular recruitment and slow growth rates are factors that make this species vulnerable to stock depletion and spills. The known distribution of Stimpson's surfclam is based on several sources of information: exploratory fisheries, scientific surveys and fishermen's logbooks.

The Greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities indicator reports total emissions of large greenhouse gas emitters in Canada for the year 2017. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ensures that greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's largest emitters are measured and reported. This mandatory reporting contributes to the development, implementation and evaluation of climate change and energy policies and strategies in Canada. Greenhouse gas emissions data reported through the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program are used, where appropriate, to confirm the reasonableness of estimates of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada in the National Inventory Report. Information is provided to Canadians in a number of formats including: static and interactive maps, charts and graphs, HTML and CSV data tables and downloadable reports.

The Air pollutant emissions indicators track emissions from human activities of 6 key air pollutants: sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. Black carbon, which is a component of fine particulate matter, is also reported. Sectoral indicators on air pollutant emissions from transportation, off-road vehicles and mobile equipment, electric utilities and the oil and gas industry provide additional analysis on the largest sources of Canada's air pollutant emissions. For each air pollutant, the indicators are provided at the national and provincial/territorial levels. They also identify the major sources of emissions and provide links to detailed information on air pollutant emissions from facilities. The Air pollutant emissions indicators are intended to inform Canadians and decision makers about progress made towards reducing emissions from human-related sources of air pollutants and about the effectiveness of emission reduction measures implemented to improve ambient air quality in Canada.

1006,Chum Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013.

1010,Even Year Pink Salmon CU Boundary,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016).

CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013.

1020,Coho Salmon CU Status,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs).

Sci. 2916: vii + 72 pages. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/342703.pdf Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

These data represent the five classification categories of marine bivalve shellfish harvest areas (Approved; Conditionally Approved; Restricted; Conditionally Restricted; and Prohibited) under the Canadian Shellfish Sanitation Program (CSSP). Data are collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) for the purpose of making applicable classification recommendations on the basis of sanitary and water quality survey results. ECCC recommendations are reviewed and adopted by Regional Interdepartmental Shellfish Committees prior to regulatory implementation by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). These geographic data are for illustrative purposes only; they show shellfish harvest area classifications when in Open Status. The classification may be superseded at any time by regulatory orders issued by DFO, which place areas in Closed Status, due to conditions such as sewage overflows or elevated biotoxin levels. For further information about the current status and boundary coordinates for areas under Prohibition Order, please contact your local DFO office.

1028,Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - High Arctic,cgp_aafc,"The High Arctic dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area is located in the High Arctic Archipelago and contains both marine and terrestrial components. The boundaries of the study area are based on the NOGB leasing grids applied in the High Arctic, under which exploration, significant discovery and production licenses may be issued. The Sverdrup Basin (and Lancaster Sound) has the highest known oil and gas potential of the sedimentary basins of the Arctic Islands (Nunavut Planning Commission 2000) and it is expected that there is oil and gas potential on Melville Island and Bathurst Island (Sivummut Economic Development Strategy Group 2003). To date, no gas has been produced, and 321,470 m³ of oil has been produced from the Bent Horn oil field (Morrell et al. 1995).

Additional information The MICS (Mingan Island Cetacean Study) has been collecting and compiling in a photo-identification catalogue, blue whale (and other type of whales) sightings for the western North Atlantic since 1979. Since 1987, the material and sampling protocol has been being relatively stable, neither random nor systematic. Field work is conducted abord inflatable boats. Because the whole Gulf ot St. Lawrence cannot be thoroughly studied, MCIS conducts surveys in known whale aggregation areas. The spatial effort is also weather dependent and is mainly constrained by wind direction and strength. Therefore, the study area is not homogeneously covered. Each whale observation is associated with a picture that allows individual identification based on the animal's pigmentation pattern.

1031,Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - Eastern Arctic,cgp_aafc,"The Eastern Arctic dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area is located east of Baffin Island, Nunavut and encompasses marine habitat in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The boundaries of the study area are based on NOGB leasing grids applied in the Eastern Arctic, under which exploration and production licenses may be issued. Although portions of the study area hold high oil and gas potential and several small oil fields and substantial reserves of gas have been found since the 1960s in the north Baffin region, exploration for oil and gas has been limited to seismic operations and geological field work. DISCLAIMER: Please refer to the PEMT Disclaimer document or the Resource Constraints - Use Limitation in the Additional Information section below. Note: This is one of the 3 (three) datasets included in the PEMT application which includes the Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie Delta and High Arctic datasets.

1032,Critical habitat of the St. Lawrence estuary population of Striped Bass,cgp_aafc,"Striped Bass critical habitat (St. Lawrence estuary population) defined by the analysis of available knowledge in 2011 and a scientific advice. Purpose The status of the Striped Bass population of the St. Lawrence Estuary is in constant evolution. It went from indigenous population until the end of 1960 to designated extirpated in Canada under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2011. Still in 2011, the status of the population of the St. Lawrence Estuary was reassessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) following the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune du Québec re-introduction efforts and was designated endangered (COSEWIC 2012). Under SARA, critical habitat must be designated for all threatened, endangered or extirpated species. Additional Information The analysis of available knowledge on habitat quality assessment and its use by the Striped Bass was realized using two research documents: Pelletier et al. (2010) and Robitaille (2010). These documents were then reviewed during a scientific peer review meeting in April 2010. A Recovery Strategy was also established in 2011. Pelletier, A.-M., G.

1037,Coastal and epipelagic habitats of the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf - Database,cgp_aafc,"A geospatial database involving 130 descriptors was created describing the pelagic and benthic habitats of the 0-30 m surface layer in the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. A grid made of 6.25 km² cells (2.5 x 2.5 km) was used to aggregate the data. Each of the 39,337 cells overlapping the marine environment was characterized using landscape, hydrographic, and oceanographic parameters determined from observations (including satellite imagery), a 3D circulation model, and published and unpublished material available at local and regional scales. Purpose The dataset provides useful information on the spatial extent of major coastal epipelagic habitats in the study area and can be used for mapping purposes and for analyses of species-habitat relationships. Additional Information The low tide limit was taken as the upper (0 m) boundary, but neighbouring landscape features, such as the proximity to freshwater inflows, surface area of the tidal zone, and characteristics of the shoreline, were also taken into consideration. Also, each cell was classified as being marine, intertidal, or terrestrial using the high and low tide marks. Those marks were determined using NRCan CANVEC topographic map products (1:50,000). The high tide mark was determined as the limit between the land and water layers. The low tide mark (0 m depth) was determined as the lower limit of the tidal zone in areas with a tidal zone, and as the limit between the land and water layers elsewhere. See the report mentioned below for a more detailed description of the treatments for each variable: Dutil, J.-D., S. Proulx, P. Galbraith, J. Chassé and N. Lambert 2012.

1038,"Benthic substrates of the Saguenay fjord, the St. Lawrence lower estuary and Gulf",cgp_aafc,"Description of the submarine morphology and characteristics of the sediments (lithology, grain size, mineralogy, and chemistry) of the Saguenay fjord, the lower Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. The layer contains a synthesis of geological and geochemical data collected and interpreted over 10 years and is accompanied by detailed bathymetric and surface sediment maps. Most of this study deals with the geomorphology, surface sediments (lithology, mineralogy, and chemistry), and present depositional conditions, but several studies have also been made of the bedrock geology and the stratigraphy of the unconsolidated sediments. Purpose These studies are regional and of a reconnaissance nature in the sense that they have been designed to obtain acoustical and sampling data on the morphology and basic properties of the sediments from the whole Gulf. This approach was used to provide a broad appraisal of the sedimentary environment of the Gulf and its late-glacial and postglacial history. Additional Information Unknown date of numeric version. Acoustical and sampling data were obtained in the River and Gulf of St. Lawrence on board of different boats over the years. Sounding lines and sample stations were selected initially on the basis of submarine morphology and later in combination with a preliminary sedimentological map as the sea floor data accumulated. More specifically, acoustical data on the topography and nature of the sea floor was obtained from echosounding and continuous seismic profiling. Sounding records were studied, interpreted, and reduced manually in most cases to a scale suitable for plotting and presentation. The information on the continuous seismic records was first interpreted visually and the reduced to constant scale with the aid of a pantograph with independently vertical and horizontal scales. Also, about 1500 sediments samples have been collected from various parts of the Gulf to obtain a regional coverage of the sedimentary environment in the area. The sediment sample were sorted and split after their water content had been determined. Mineralogical analyses were carried out after separation into a heavy and light fraction.

1043,Chinook Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013. Please be aware that CUs may be reviewed and are subject to change without notice.

These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990. Protocols for Research Vessel Cruises within the Gulf Region (Demersal Fish) (1970-1987). Can. MS Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. No. 2082: 143p.

Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol.

The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The pelagic species represented are: Arctic Cod, Atlantic Argentine, Atlantic Herring, Atlantic Mackerel, Atlantic Soft Pout, Capelin, Lumpfish, Pollock, Rainbow Smelt, Sand Lances, Silver Hake, Threespine Stickleback and White Barracudina. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

1206,MERLUCCIUS BILINEARIS S,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 pelagic fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The pelagic species represented are: Arctic Cod, Atlantic Argentine, Atlantic Herring, Atlantic Mackerel, Atlantic Soft Pout, Capelin, Lumpfish, Pollock, Rainbow Smelt, Sand Lances, Silver Hake, Threespine Stickleback and White Barracudina. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

Many of our waterways along the coastline have to be dredged regularly to keep shipping channels and harbours open and safe for navigation; and this material is sometimes best disposed of at sea. Schedule 5 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) defines an exclusive list of materials and substances suitable for disposal at sea in Canada, which is in accordance with the London Protocol (1996). They are: dredged material, fish waste resulting from industrial fish processing operations, ships or platforms, inert and inorganic geological matter, uncontaminated organic matter of natural origin, and bulky substances. The disposal of any substance into the sea, on the seabed, in the subsoil of the seabed, or onto ice, from a ship, an aircraft, a platform or other structure is not allowed unless a permit is issued by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Disposal at Sea Program. Incineration at sea, as well as importing or exporting a substance for disposal at sea is also prohibited.

1220,Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) - Critical Habitat for Species at Risk - Atlantic Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador),cgp_aafc,"This dataset displays the geographic areas within which critical habitat for terrestrial species at risk, listed on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), occurs in Atlantic Canada: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Note that this includes only terrestrial species and species for which Environment and Climate Change Canada is the lead. However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with the information provided in a species' recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (""biophysical attributes"") that complete the definition of a species' critical habitat. Each species' dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data for all terrestrial species in Atlantic Canada that is available for download. The collection includes critical habitat as it is depicted in final recovery documents. It is important to note that recovery documents, and therefore critical habitat, may be amended from time to time. Also, new species can be added to Schedule 1 of SARA and thus new critical habitat described when additional recovery documents are posted on the SAR Public Registry. As critical habitat is amended, this dataset will be updated; however the SAR Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca) should always be considered the definitive source for critical habitat information.

1221,Fixed Stations / Stations Fixes,cgp_aafc,"Bottom dissolved oxygen time series at the 3 fixed stations and 46 stations, grouped into transects, of the Atlantic Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) under the Quebec region responsibility. The mean bottom dissolved oxygen of the last ten years are displayed as 2 layers, one for the June survey (2008-2017), another for the autumn survey (2008-2017). A third layer shows the positions of the fixed stations of the program (Anticosti Gyre, Gaspé Current and Rimouski). Each station is linked with a .png file showing the bottom dissolved oxygen time series and with a .csv file containing all the bottom dissolved oxygen data acquired at those stations since the beginning of the program sampling (columns : Station, Latitude,Longitude,Date(UTC),Sounding(m),Depth/Profondeur(m),Dissolved_Oxygen/Oxygène_Dissous(%sat)). Purpose The Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program (AZMP) was implemented in 1998 with the aim of increasing the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada's (DFO) capacity to detect, track and predict changes in the state and productivity of the marine environment. The AZMP collects data from a network of stations composed of high-frequency monitoring sites and cross-shelf sections in each following DFO region: Québec, Gulf, Maritimes and Newfoundland. The sampling design provides basic information on the natural variability in physical, chemical, and biological properties of the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf. Cross-shelf sections sampling provides detailed geographic information but is limited in a seasonal coverage while critically placed high-frequency monitoring sites complement the geography-based sampling by providing more detailed information on temporal changes in ecosystem properties. In Quebec region, two surveys (46 stations grouped into transects) are conducted every year, one in June and the other in autumn in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Historically, 3 fixed stations were sampled more frequently. One of these is the Rimouski station that still takes part of the program and is sampled about weekly throughout the summer and occasionally in the winter period.

1224,Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites - 2018,cgp_aafc,"Canada has the longest coastline in the world, measuring 243,790 kilometers. Many of our waterways along the coastline have to be dredged regularly to keep shipping channels and harbours open and safe for navigation; and this material is sometimes best disposed of at sea. Schedule 5 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA) defines an exclusive list of materials and substances suitable for disposal at sea in Canada, which is in accordance with the London Protocol (1996). They are: dredged material, fish waste resulting from industrial fish processing operations, ships or platforms, inert and inorganic geological matter, uncontaminated organic matter of natural origin, and bulky substances. The disposal of any substance into the sea, on the seabed, in the subsoil of the seabed, or onto ice, from a ship, an aircraft, a platform or other structure is not allowed unless a permit is issued by the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Disposal at Sea Program. Incineration at sea, as well as importing or exporting a substance for disposal at sea is also prohibited. More information on Disposal at Sea is available at: https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/disposal-at-sea.html The Active and Inactive Disposal at Sea Sites in Canadian Waters dataset provides spatial and related information of at-sea disposal sites approved for use in Canada in the last ten years and that remain open for consideration for additional use. Any additional use of a disposal site must be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of a valid Disposal at Sea permit.

1230,Megahabitats of the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf - Personnal Geodatabase,cgp_aafc,"Available information for the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence on salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, depth, slope, and variability in landscape and sediments, were aggregated using a grid made up of 100 km2 cells as a basis for mapping and describing marine habitats for conservation and integrated management purposes. For example, 26 variables were selected to describe depth, slope, salinity and temperature. Based on that information, cluster analyses were conducted grouping cells into 13 different megahabitats. Four megahabitats described the deep waters, and areas outside channels formed 9 megahabitats: four in the southern Gulf and five in the northern Gulf. Purpose The tool proposes a novel way of making validated and integrated data available to end users. Potential applications include the screening of areas considered for inclusion in a network of protected areas and a quantitative assessment of surface areas for each class of habitat. The method can also be applied to describe the habitats of species at risk.

These files were produced by Statistics Canada, Environment, Energy and Transportation Statistics Division, 2018, special tabulation from the 2001 and 2016 Census of Population; Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Services, Economic Analysis Division; Canada’s National Forest Inventory (NFI), 2016, Grouped kNN Map layers, http://tree.pfc.forestry.ca (accessed April 7, 2017). Data from the 2016 Census of Population were used to identify the 105 census subdivisions. Note that changes occur to the number and the boundaries of CSDs between censuses. Adjustments were made to CSD boundaries to account for changes. Some data were suppressed for data quality reasons or to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act. Income data were available for 3,675 of 5,162 CSDs. This analysis may therefore underreport the total number of communities for which the forest sector is a major economic driver. Note that a decline in the percentage of forest sector income may be due to a decrease in forest sector income or an increase in income from other sources. The reference period for income data in the Census of Population is the calendar year prior to the census.

1232,Bottom water pH in the Estuary and Gulf of St.Lawrence,cgp_aafc,"Gridded pH of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence bottom waters including shallow waters. Data are a result of a 3D interpolation on a 1km x 1km x bottom depth grid. All the available CTD data sampled during the 2017 August and September multidisciplinary surveys were used. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

The SLOSH Basin used for mapping was Chesapeake Bay (CP5), released in 2014. This data was prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, Planning Division in January 2016.SLOSH storm tide elevations used for this mapping are based on the Maximum of Maximums (MOM) SLOSH output dataset. The MOM output elevations represent the highest calculated storm tide values based on thousands of SLOSH simulations using different combinations of approach direction, forward speed, landfall point, astronomical tide, and intensity (Category 1 through Category 4). Categories 1 through 4 refer to the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity.This map does not reflect the expected storm tide flooding for every hurricane, or for any one particular type of hurricane. This map shows the overall footprint of the area that has some risk of storm tide flooding from hurricanes, based on the MOM output dataset. The purpose of this data is to support hurricane emergency management planning activities.For more information on the SLOSH model and the MOM dataset, please visit http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/surge/slosh.php.",Feature Layer,"June 25, 2019",19,"['aug2016', 'DC GIS', 'District of Columbia', 'Environment', 'Environmental', 'Hurricane Evacuation Study', 'NCR GDX', 'Open Data', 'Storm Surge', 'Storm Surge Inundation', 'Washington DC']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/DCGIS::storm-surge-risk-areas,Environment

This analysis, based on remote sensing data, has produced a global forest regeneration map trying to discriminate natural regeneration from other processes by assessing vegetation cover gain between 2000-2015 on areas considered not forested for about 15 years before 2000 and considered as forested since 2015 to 2018. About 60% of the mapped area for which feedback was obtained was attributed to natural regeneration. About two thirds (63%) of this forest regeneration took place in Boreal and Temperate forests, and the remaining 27% is split between tropical and subtropical forests. Additional analysis is required to understand the interactions between deforestation and forest regeneration at the global level since likely different transitions of change take place across different local specific contexts.",Raster Layer,"August 24, 2020",,"['forest', 'regeneration', 'deforestation fronts', 'global']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/panda::global-forest-regeneration,Environment

1287,2012,cgp_aafc,"Gridded temperature and salinity of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence bottom waters including shallow waters. Data are a result of a 3D interpolation on a 1km x 1km x bottom depth grid. They mostly come from the 2 multidisciplinary surveys but all the available CTD data sampled in August and September were used. The dataset contains 24 layers: one layer per year per variable from 2010 to 2019, two layers of temperature and salinity climatologies and two layers of 2019 anomalies. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

Monitoring of surface water conditions in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence is carried out with different complementary methods such as thermosalinographs (TSG) installed on commercial ships. These ships are sailing all year long from Montreal to St. John's, one round trip per week, and are sampling water near the surface (3 to 8 meters deep) to determine the temperature and salinity all along the route. Purpose The recorded data are used as input to numerical forecasting models for sea ice conditions and as a monitoring tool for the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

Failure to define an area as an EBSA does not mean that it is unimportant ecologically. All areas serve ecological functions to some extent and require sustainable management. Rather, areas identified as EBSAs should be viewed as the most important areas where, with existing knowledge, regulators and marine users should be particularly risk averse to ensure ecosystems remain healthy and productive. Why are EBSAs identified? EBSA information is used to inform marine planning, including environmental assessment and the siting of marine-based activities, by: - Informing and guiding project-specific or regional environmental assessments; - Informing and guiding industries and regulators in their planning and operations, for example: EBSAs have been acknowledged and referred to (often as ""Special Areas"" or ""Potentially Sensitive Areas"") in oil and gas related assessments; - EBSA information has been provided to proponents of submarine cable projects to be used for route planning purposes; - Informing and guiding Integrated Oceans Management (IOM) process within five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) and twelve marine bioregions; - Serving as a basis for the identification of Areas of Interest (AOIs) and of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (individually and in the context of planning bioregional networks of MPAs). How are EBSAs identified? The process used to identify EBSAs is generally comprised of two phases. The first phase involves compiling scientific data and knowledge of a marine area's ecosystems - notably fish species, marine mammals, sea birds, marine flora, marine productivity, physical and chemical conditions and geology. ""Knowledge"" includes experiential knowledge of long-time uses of the areas. In some cases (e.g., in the Arctic), substantial efforts are taken to collect traditional knowledge on ecosystems and environmental conditions from community members, fish harvests, hunters and individuals whose knowledge of the study area complement often helps fill scientific data gaps. In the second phase, the available information for a marine area (e.g. a bioregion) is assessed against five nationally-established science-based criteria including: - Uniqueness: How distinct is the ecosystem of an area compared to surrounding ones? - Aggregation: Whether or not species populate or convene to the study area? - Fitness consequence: How critical the area is to the life history of the species that use it (e.g. is it a spawning or feeding ground)? - Naturalness: How pristine or disturbed by human activities is the study area? - Resilience: What is the ability of the ecosystem to bounce back if it is disturbed? Progress to date and next steps EBSAs have been identified for large portions of Canada's Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as most of the Arctic oceans. EBSAs will continue to be identified in priority areas as resources become available to carry out the process. The boundaries or locations of existing EBSAs may be modified to reflect both new knowledge and changing environmental conditions.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",203,"['Atlantic Ocean', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Canada', 'Arctic Ocean', 'EBSA', 'Oceans', 'Ecosystems', 'Biological diversity', 'Conservation', 'DFO', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', 'f5328ddc-3dff-4b25-a613-021d9fa411e8']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/8475be4bb9324fd1be8e14f67c26328b_0,Environment

The first phase involves compiling scientific data and knowledge of a marine area's ecosystems - notably fish species, marine mammals, sea birds, marine flora, marine productivity, physical and chemical conditions and geology. ""Knowledge"" includes experiential knowledge of long-time uses of the areas. In some cases (e.g., in the Arctic), substantial efforts are taken to collect traditional knowledge on ecosystems and environmental conditions from community members, fish harvests, hunters and individuals whose knowledge of the study area complement often helps fill scientific data gaps. In the second phase, the available information for a marine area (e.g. a bioregion) is assessed against five nationally-established science-based criteria including: - Uniqueness: How distinct is the ecosystem of an area compared to surrounding ones? - Aggregation: Whether or not species populate or convene to the study area? - Fitness consequence: How critical the area is to the life history of the species that use it (e.g. is it a spawning or feeding ground)? - Naturalness: How pristine or disturbed by human activities is the study area? - Resilience: What is the ability of the ecosystem to bounce back if it is disturbed? Progress to date and next steps EBSAs have been identified for large portions of Canada's Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as most of the Arctic oceans. EBSAs will continue to be identified in priority areas as resources become available to carry out the process. The boundaries or locations of existing EBSAs may be modified to reflect both new knowledge and changing environmental conditions.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",203,"['Atlantic Ocean', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Canada', 'Arctic Ocean', 'EBSA', 'Oceans', 'Ecosystems', 'Biological diversity', 'Conservation', 'DFO', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', 'd2d6057f-d7c4-45d9-9fd9-0a58370577e0']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2b687aaeb7df433d8e71ec188e7d7de6_0,Environment

1393,Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie Delta,cgp_aafc,"The Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie Delta dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area and analytical resolution was defined using the oil and gas leasing grid within the Beaufort Sea. The study area has been the scene of oil and gas exploration activity since 1957. Oil was first discovered at Atkinson Point in 1969 and major gas fields in the early 1970s. Such finds spurred the proposal of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline in 1974 and the addition of exploration and investment offshore. Exploration and drilling continued both onshore and offshore until the mid-1970s with the release of the Berger Report, which recommended a 10-year moratorium on the construction of the pipeline. After the release of the Berger Report, the pace of onshore activity declined but offshore exploration escalated in the 1980s. Offshore exploration was facilitated with innovative operating techniques and new offshore platforms that extended the ability to operate in the short open-water season and ice. With the minor exception of the small onshore gas field at Ikhil, no oil or gas has been commercially produced in the area.

1394,Oceans Act Areas of Interest,cgp_aafc,"The selection of an Area of Interest (AOI) marks the beginning of the Oceans Act Marine Protected Area (MPA) establishment process led by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The process includes completing detailed ecological and socioeconomic assessments, setting conservation objectives, determining boundaries and management measures, and eventually developing the regulations under section 35 of the Oceans Act. Stakeholders are involved in each step of this process. There is considerable scientific evidence that marine protected areas provide a number of ecological benefits, including the enhanced recruitment of fish species, including those of commercial value, through the protection of spawning areas, larval sources, habitats and migration routes. A well-designed MPA network can scale these benefits up to the regional level, and provide benefits that individual marine protected areas cannot provide on their own. For example, strategically placing marine protected areas in a network can protect key stops along a species' migration route, and protect geographically distinct habitats that serve important life history functions. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization has recognized the use of marine protected areas as complementary to conventional fisheries management measures in helping to achieve sustainable fisheries management objectives.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",7,"['Arctic Ocean', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Marine Protected Area', 'Area of Interest', 'Race Rocks', 'St. Lawrence Estuary', 'Shediac Valley', 'AOI', 'Eastern Shore Islands', 'Offshore Pacific', 'Fundian Channel-Browns Bank', 'Southampton Island', 'Marine conservation areas', 'Aquatic ecosystems', 'Marine heritage', 'DFO', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', '32bf34ea-d51f-46c9-9945-563989dfcc7b']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/775355a1fd5546ba9c713852eef323d9_0,Environment

1396,Atlantic Colonies - Density Analysis,cgp_aafc,"Data Sources: Banque informatisée des oiseaux de mer au Québec (BIOMQ: ECCC-CWS Quebec Region) Atlantic Colonial Waterbird Database (ACWD: ECCC-CWS Atlantic Region).. Both the BIOMQ and ACWD contain records of individual colony counts, by species, for known colonies located in Eastern Canada. Although some colonies are censused annually, most are visited much less frequently. Methods used to derive colony population estimates vary markedly among colonies and among species. For example, census methods devised for burrow-nesting alcids typically rely on ground survey techniques. As such, they tend to be restricted to relatively few colonies. In contrast, censuses of large gull or tern colonies, which are geographically widespread, more appropriately rely on a combination of broad-scale aerial surveys, and ground surveys at a subset of these colonies. In some instances, ground surveys of certain species are not available throughout the study area. In such cases, consideration of other sources, including aerial surveys, may be appropriate. For example,data stemming from a 2006 aerial survey of Common Eiders during nesting, conducted by ECCC-CWS in Labrador, though not yet incorporated in the ACWD, were used in this report. It is important to note that colony data for some species, such as herons, are not well represented in these ECCC-CWS databases at present. Analysis of ACWD and BIOMQ data (ECCC-CWS Quebec and Atlantic Regions): Data were merged as temporal coverage, survey methods and geospatial information were comparable. Only in cases where total counts of individuals were not explicitly presented was it necessary to calculate proxies of total counts of breeding individuals (e.g., by doubling numbers of breeding pairs or of active nests). Though these approaches may underestimate the true number of total individuals associated with a given site by failing to include some proportion of the non-breeding population (i.e., visiting adult non-breeders, sub-adults and failed breeders), tracking numbers of breeding individuals (or pairs) is considered to be the primary focus of these colony monitoring programs.In order to represent the potential number of individuals of a given species that realistically could be and may historically have been present at a given colony location (see section 1.1), the maximum total count obtained per species per site since 1960 was used in the analyses. In the case of certain species,especially coastal piscivores (Wires et al. 2001; Cotter et al. 2012), maxima reached in the 1970s or 1980s likely resulted from considerable anthropogenic sources of food, and these levels may never be seen again. The effect may have been more pronounced in certain geographic areas. Certain sites once used as colonies may no longer be suitable for breeding due to natural and/or human causes, but others similarly may become suitable and thus merit consideration in long-term habitat conservation planning. A colony importance index (CII) was derived by dividing the latter maximum total count by the potential total Eastern Canadian breeding population of that species (the sum of maximum total counts within a species, across all known colony sites in Eastern Canada). The CII approximates the proportion of the total potential Eastern Canadian breeding population (sum of maxima) reached at each colony location and allowed for an objective comparison among colonies both within and across species. In some less-frequently visited colonies, birds (cormorants, gulls, murres and terns, in particular) were not identified to species. Due to potential biases and issues pertaining to inclusion of these data, they were not considered when calculating species' maximum counts by colony for the CII. The IBA approach whereby maximum colony counts are divided by the size of the corresponding actual estimated population for each species (see Table 3.1.2; approximate 1% continental threshold presented) was not used because in some instances individuals were not identified to species at some sites, or population estimates were unavailable.Use of both maxima and proportions of populations (or an index thereof) presents contrasting, but complementary, approaches to identifying important colonial congregations. By examining results derived from both approaches, attention can be directed at areas that not only host large numbers of individuals, but also important proportions of populations. This dual approach avoids attributing disproportionate attention to species that by their very nature occur in very large colonies (e.g., Leach's Storm Petrel) or conversely to colonies that host important large proportions of less-abundant species (Roseate Tern, Caspian Tern, Black-Headed Gull, etc.), but in smaller overall numbers. Point Density Analysis (ArcGIS Spatial Analyst) with kernel estimation, and a 10-km search radius,was used to generate maps illustrating the density of colony measures (i.e., maximum count by species,CII by species), modelled as a continuous field (Gatrell et al. 1996). Actual colony locations were subsequently overlaid on the resulting cluster map. Sites not identified as important should not be assumed to be unimportant.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020","6,664","['Eastern Canada', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Bird Colonies', 'Seabirds', 'Nature and Biodiversity', 'Protect Species Well-Being', 'Assess Status of Species', 'Atlantic - Prince Edward Island (PE)', 'Birds', 'ECCC', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', '87bf8597-4be4-4ec2-9ee3-797f5eafbd97']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/19225be50a5a4e48ab9774fb5426746d_0,Environment

Determining the abundance of songbird species associated with various habitat type(s) and understanding how the type and number of birds varies with type and amount of habitat, are important components of assessing the effect of habitat disturbance. Regional-scale monitoring focuses on understanding how and why boreal songbirds, including several Species at Risk, are affected by human activity across the Peace, Athabasca and Cold Lake oil sands area. Local-scale projects focus on addressing gaps in our understanding of complex response patterns at regional scales by targeting specific habitats or development features of interest. These data contribute to: a. improving the design of monitoring programs; b. explaining observed trends in populations (why bird populations are increasing or decreasing); c. predicting population sizes within the oil sands area; and d. assessing the individual, additive and cumulative effects of oil sands and other resource development on boreal birds.

Well-managed conserved areas are one way to protect wild species and their habitats for present and future generations. Habitat conservation is a measure of human response to the loss of biodiversity and natural habitat. As the conserved area in Canada increases, more lands and waters are withdrawn from direct human development stresses, thereby contributing to biodiversity conservation and improving the health of ecosystems.

The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery. For the 30-metre database only, the line and poly data were buffered by a 500-metre radius, representing their extended zone of impact upon boreal caribou herds. Additionally, forest fire polygons were merged into the anthropogenic footprint in order to create an overall disturbance footprint.

The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery. For the 30-metre database only, the line and poly data were buffered by a 500-metre radius, representing their extended zone of impact upon boreal caribou herds. Additionally, forest fire polygons were merged into the anthropogenic footprint in order to create an overall disturbance footprint.

The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery. For the 30-metre database only, the line and poly data were buffered by a 500-metre radius, representing their extended zone of impact upon boreal caribou herds. Additionally, forest fire polygons were merged into the anthropogenic footprint in order to create an overall disturbance footprint.

The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery. For the 30-metre database only, the line and poly data were buffered by a 500-metre radius, representing their extended zone of impact upon boreal caribou herds. Additionally, forest fire polygons were merged into the anthropogenic footprint in order to create an overall disturbance footprint. These buffered datasets were used in the calculation of range disturbance levels and for integrated risk assessment analysis.",Feature Layer,"March 4, 2020","24,956","['anthropogenic disturbance', 'boreal', 'forest', 'caribou', 'habitat', 'mapping', 'landcover', 'landuse', 'Nature and Biodiversity', 'Protect Species Well-Being', 'Develop Species Recovery / Management / Conservation Plans', 'National (CA)', 'Ecosystems', 'ECCC', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', 'a71ab99c-6756-4e56-9d2e-2a63246a5e94']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/545f922fff514b298a64d6791296289d_170,Environment

The original disturbance mapping was based on 30-metre resolution Landsat-5 imagery from 2008 -2010. The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery. For the 30-metre database only, the line and poly data were buffered by a 500-metre radius, representing their extended zone of impact upon boreal caribou herds. Additionally, forest fire polygons were merged into the anthropogenic footprint in order to create an overall disturbance footprint.

The original disturbance mapping was based on 30-metre resolution Landsat-5 imagery from 2008 -2010. The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges.

The original disturbance mapping was based on 30-metre resolution Landsat-5 imagery from 2008 -2010.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

The original disturbance mapping was based on 30-metre resolution Landsat-5 imagery from 2008 -2010.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges.

The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges.

Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible.

1674,WilliamLake Range Aire Range Aire,cgp_aafc,"As part of a scientific assessment of critical habitat for boreal woodland caribou (Environment Canada 2011, see full reference in accompanying documentation), Environment Canada's Landscape Science and Technology Division was tasked with providing detailed anthropogenic disturbance mapping, across known caribou ranges, as of 2015. This data comprises a 5-year update to the mapping of 2008-2010 disturbances, and allows researchers to better understand the attributes that have a known effect on caribou population persistence. The original disturbance mapping was based on 30-metre resolution Landsat-5 imagery from 2008 -2010. The mapping process used in 2010 was repeated using 2015 Landsat imagery to create a nationally consistent, reliable and repeatable geospatial dataset that followed a common methodology. The methods developed were focused on mapping disturbances at a specific point of time, and were not designed to identify the age of disturbances, which can be of particular interest for disturbances that can be considered non-permanent, for example cutblocks. The resultant datasets were used for a caribou resource selection function (habitat modeling) and to assess overall disturbance levels on each caribou ranges. Anthropogenic disturbances within 51 caribou ranges across Canada were mapped. The ranges were defined by individual provinces and territories across Canada. Disturbances were remapped across these ranges using 2015 Landsat-8 satellite imagery to provide the most up-to-date data possible. As with the 2010 mapping project, anthropogenic disturbance was defined as any human-caused disturbance to the natural landscape that could be visually identified from Landsat imagery with 30-metre multi-band imagery at a viewing scale of 1:50,000. A minimum mapping unit MMU of 2 ha (approximately 22 contiguous 30-metre pixels) was selected. Each disturbance feature type was represented in the database by a line or polygon depending on their geometric description. Polygonal disturbances included: cutblocks, mines, reservoirs, built-up areas, well sites, agriculture, oil and gas facilities, as well as unknown features. Linear disturbances included: roads, railways, powerlines, seismic exploration lines, pipelines, dams, air strips, as well as unknown features. For each type of anthropogenic disturbance, a clear description was established (see Appendix 7.2 of the science assessment) to maintain consistency in identifying the various disturbances in the imagery by the different interpreters. Features were only digitized if they were visible in the Landsat imagery at the prescribed viewing scale. A 2nd interpreter quality-control phase was carried out to ensure high quality, complete and consistent data collection. For this 2015 update an additional, separate higher-resolution database was created by repeating the process using 15-metre panchromatic imagery.

Results based on a cross-validation approach show that the model explained 82% of the variance in AGB, with a root mean square error of 50.5 Mg ha-1 for a range of biomass between 0 and 454 Mg ha-1 . Analysis of lidar metrics from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS), which are sensitive to vegetation structure, indicate that the model successfully captured the regional distribution of AGB.

1717, New Zealand River Environment Classification REC2 (v2.5) Download [Esri File Geodatabase Format],National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research | steinmetzt_NIWA,"A zipped download package of an Esri File Geodatabase (River Environment Classification, REC 2 v 5, June 2019). This is a large download (>450 MB).REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.5) - June 2019  The River Environment Classification (REC) is a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers. The attributes were compiled for the purposes of river classification, while the river network description has been used to underpin models. Typically, models (e.g. CLUES and TopNet) would use the dendritic (branched) linkages of REC river segments to perform their calculations. Since its release and use over the last decade, some errors in the location and connectivity of these linkages have been identified. The current revision corrects those errors, and updates a number of spatial attributes with the latest data. REC2 provides a recut framework of rivers for modelling and classification. It is built on a newer version of the 30m digital elevation model, in which the original 20m contours were supplemented with, for example, more spot elevation data and a better coastline contour. Boundary errors were minimised by processing contiguous areas (such as the whole of the North Island) together, which wasn't possible a decade ago. Major updates include the revision of catchment land use information, by overlaying with the latest land cover database (LCDB3, current as at 2008), and the update of river and rainfall statistics with data from 1960-2006. The river network and associated attributes have been assembled within an ArcGIS geodatabase as a Geometric Network. Topological connectivity has been established to allow upstream and downstream tracing within the network.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.

1749,NOAA Surge MOM Matagorda Bay,Houston-Galveston Area Council | hgacDSgis,"This file contains all the MOMs generated by the National Hurricane Center for the Matagorda Bay SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes) basin. A MOM(also known as the Maximum of MEOWs) depicts the potential flooding for a given Saffir-Simpson hurricane category, and is a composite of the maximum storm surge heights for all simulated hurricanes of that category regardless of direction and speed. A basin is a collection of bathymetry and topography used by the SLOSH model to compute storm surge. SLOSH is a numerical model used by the NWS to compute storm surge, an abnormal change in the water level due to a storm's winds and pressure. This is an ensemble product of maximum storm surge heights for all hurricanes of a given category regardless of forward speed, storm trajectory, landfall location, etc. MOMs are created internally by pooling all the MEOWs for a given basin and high tide level, and selecting the MEOW with the greatest storm surge value for each basin grid cell regardless of the forward speed, storm trajectory, or landfall location. As with the MEOW, it is unknown (to the user) which combination of forward speed, storm trajectory, or track generated the MOM used for particular cell. This procedure is repeated for each storm category. In total 10 MOMs are made available for each basin - one MOM per storm category for high tide. MOMs represent the worst case scenario for a given category of storm under ""perfect"" storm conditions. The MOMs provide useful information aiding in hurricane evacuation planning and are also used to develop the nation's evacuation zones.

1751,Contour 2ft (2011),City of Kerrville | opendata_kerrvilletx,"The 2ft Contours 2011 is intended to be used for general reference and visualization, and is not suitable for analysis and is not a substitute for a survey conducted by an on-the-ground survey conducted by or under the supervision of a registered professional land surveyor.The two foot contours were derived from 2011 lidar data. The lidar was filtered to ground points only and exported to a multipoint dataset. The multipoint dataset, breaklines, and project extent were used to create a terrain dataset. Building footprints were used to remove any points that fell inside a building footprint due to misclassification of the lidar point. A digital elevation model (DEM) was created from the terrain dataset with a 10-ft cell size. The 10-ft DEM was smoothed using focal statistics by averaging a 3x3 cell sized rectangular area across the entire DEM. Contours were created from the smoothed DEM at a two foot interval with a base elevation of 1,500 feet. Contours smaller than 39.5-ft were removed and contours completely within waterbodies were removed. The contours were then split into 20 rows by 10 columns to improve performance. Then the contours were run through a smoothing process to remove sharp bends in the lines without affecting the general location of the lines. Lastly index intervals were calculated for 10-ft, 20-ft, 50-ft, and 100-ft.The lidar collection that the 2ft Contours 2011 was created from was flown and processed by Merrick & Company, covering portions of Blanco, Caldwell, DeWitt, Gonzales, Kendall and Kerr counties in central Texas. Aerial collection took place from January to March 2011 during the leaf-off season. URS provided third-party quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC).
