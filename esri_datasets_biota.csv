"Harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) counts and haulout locations in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia coast",cgp_aafc,"Harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) are found along temperate and Arctic marine coastlines of the Northern Hemisphere. They are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as well as those of the Baltic and North Seas. In Canada, they may be found off the coastal waters of British Columbia, Nunavut, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Population trends and abundance of harbour seals in British Columbia are assessed based on aerial surveys conducted during 1966-2014. Based on counts conducted in Index Areas distributed throughout the province, the trend observed in the Strait of Georgia appears to be indicative of harbour seal populations throughout British Columbia. Total abundance of harbour seals on the B.C. coast in 2008 was estimated to be on the order of about 105,000 (95% confidence interval of 90,900 to 118,900) seals. Historic reconstructions indicate the population was depleted by a period of commercial harvesting during 1879-1914, and subsequently maintained below natural levels by predator control programs until the early 1960s. Already depleted, the population could not sustain a second period of intense commercial harvesting during 1962-1968 and was further depleted, but now appears to have fully recovered.

Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) counts and haulout locations across the British Columbia coast,cgp_aafc,"Considered the ""king"" of sea lions, the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) is the biggest of all sea lions and enjoys a lifespan of up to thirty years. In Canada, the Steller can be spotted along the rocky coast of British Columbia. This hefty mammal usually travels alone or in a small group, but wisely, it joins others for protection during the mating and birthing season. Little is known about its oceanic lifestyle; however, the good news for this sea-loving mammal is that since the Steller sea lion first became protected in 1970, the size of the adult population has more than doubled. Recent trends in the abundance of Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in British Columbia were assessed based on a series of thirteen province-wide aerial surveys conducted during the breeding season (27-June to 06-July) between 1971 and 2013.

June / Juin,cgp_aafc,"This layer represents areas where primary production is considered to be high. Primary production includes microscopic algal blooms, named phytoplankton, a food resource at the base of the food web of marine ecosystems. The knowledge of these zones can serve as a proxy to identify areas of the St. Lawrence where productivity is higher at different times of the year. Impacting his component may influence the rest of the life cycle in the affected area. Data were generated from the Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) developed by Dr. Diane Lavoie. This model makes it possible to calculate, using 10 variables, the primary production in each cell of the grid of the model. This calculation was done at a monthly resolution and a threshold was then applied to the data to keep only those cells where the estimated concentrations exceeded 20 mg C / m-2. This level of primary production is considered high. Additional Information Monthly mean primary production (mg C m-2) in the first 50 meters of the simulated surface with the three-dimensional CANOPA-GSBM numerical model over a period of 13 years (1998-2010). The Gulf of St. Lawrence Biogeochemical Model (GSBM) simulates biogeochemical cycles of oxygen, carbon and nitrogen, and the biological components that determine the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem. The model has 10 state variables. The NPZD (nutrients, primary production, zooplankton, detritus) model includes both simplified herbivorous and microbial food chains typical of bloom and post-bloom conditions. The export of biogenic matter at depth is mediated by the herbivorous food web (nitrate, large phytoplankton (diatoms), mesozooplankton, particulate organic matter), while the microbial food web (ammonium, small phytoplankton, microzooplankton, dissolved organic matter) is mainly responsible for nutrient recycling in the euphotic zone. Nitrate is also supplied by rivers. The tight coupling between small phytoplankton growth and microzooplankton grazing, autochtonous nitrogen release and (dissolved organic nitrogen) DON remineralization to ammonium (NH4+) is used to represent the dynamic of the microbial food chain. Biological transfer functions are derived from bulk formulations using mean parameters found in the literature. Biological variables are calculated in nitrogen units and algal biomass and production converted to Chl a and carbon units using fixed stoichiometric ratios. Detrital particulate organic nitrogen (PON) gets fragmented to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) as it sinks toward the bottom. The phytoplankton growth rate is a function of light and nutrient availability. The available light for phytoplankton growth is a function of sea-ice cover, Chl a and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The GSBM biogeochemical model, coupled with the CANOPA regional circulation model, was used to produce the Chl a layer. The grid of the model is 1/12° horizontally (about 6 x 8 km), 46 layers vertical and covers the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf and Gulf of Maine regions. The vertical resolution is variable (between 6 m close to the surface to 90 m at depths of about 500 m). This model includes tidal forcing and the freshwater supply of the St. Lawrence River and the many rivers in the region, as well as atmospheric forcing (temperature, wind, etc.) produced by an independent model (National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2). In addition, the circulation model is coupled with a model of sea ice that reproduces the seasonality of the ice cover in the region. The temperature and salinity fields are produced freely by the model and only constrained by monthly climatologies of these conditions at the boundaries of the model domain. The simulation was carried out over a part of the period covering the Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) from 1998 to 2010.

August / Août,cgp_aafc,"Krill is a generic name for crustaceans of the order Euphausiids, most of which are known to be Thysanoessa raschii and Meganyctiphanes norvegica in eastern Canada. Krill is an important food resource for many marine mammals, in particular the blue whale. The maps show the points of high krill concentration per month from April to November. Each point gives the number of years of high aggregation probability (6 to 10 years). The data were produced from a mathematical model developed in Plourde et al. 2016. The model has allowed to calculate the probability of meeting a strong aggregation of krill over a period of 10 years. High krill aggregations are defined as the 95th percentile of predicted biomass in 10 x 10 km cells covering the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence. Additional Information Plourde, S., Lehoux, C., McQuinn, I.H., and Lesage, V. (2016). Describing krill distribution in the western North Atlantic using statistical habitat models. DFO Can. Sci.

Spatial distribution of krill in eastern Canadian waters: a climatological approach based on historical plankton net and acoustic data.

As a continuation of previous work and to inform future assessments and conservation efforts within this geographic range, seven easily accessible sites known to have high densities of G. angulata were selected as prospective index sites to monitor relative abundance (i.e. mussel bed density) using snorkel surveys. For lake sites, a two-stage sampling design was conducted using transects and quadrats. For the river site, cumulative counts from sides of the river were collected. Some sites were sampled only once while others were sampled multiple times from 2011-2016. Mean mussel densities across all surveys ranged from 0.19 to 2.86 mussels/m2, corresponding to site abundance estimates ranging from 102 to 3,276 mussels. Depth measurements were also taken at most sites to inform the Fish Water Management Tool of the Okanagan Water Management Board.

It is currently believed that the ranges of these two cotton rat species do not overlap. Those captured south of the Trigo and Chocolate Mountains in the area of the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge and south of the Yuma, Arizona, area to date are Yuma hispid cotton rats. Those captured north of the aforementioned mountain ranges to date are Colorado River cotton rats. The northernmost historic records of Colorado River cotton rats are from an area just south of Laughlin, Nevada (Bradley 1966; Hall 1946). Colorado River cotton rats were captured in 2012 at the Big Bend Conservation Area, marking the first record of the species in Nevada since 1966.

Primary production / Production primaire,cgp_aafc,"Identification of ecological and biological significant areas (EBSA) in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence according to six groups of the food chain : primary production (Lavoie et al, 2007), secondary production (Plourde et McQuinn, 2010), meroplankton (Ouellet, 2007), benthic invertebrates (Chabot et al, 2007), demersal fishes (Castonguay et Valois, 2007) and pelagic fishes (McQuinn et al, 2012). The distribution area of each group has been evaluated using five criteria in order to determine the EBSA (DFO, 2004): 1. Uniqueness: Ranked from areas whose characteristics are unique, rare, distinct, and for which alternatives do not exist to areas whose characteristics are widespread with many areas which are similar. 2. Aggregation: Ranked from areas where most individuals of a species are aggregated to areas where individuals of the species are widespread 3. Fitness consequence: Ranked from areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make a major contribution to the fitness of the population or species present to areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make only marginal contributions to fitness. 4. Resilience: Ranked from areas where the habitat structures or species are highly sensitive, easily perturbed, and slow to recover to areas where the habitat structures or species are robust, resistant to perturbation, or readily return to the pre-perturbation state. 5. Naturalness: Ranked from areas which are pristine and characterized by native species to areas which are highly perturbed by anthropogenic activities and/or with high abundances of introduced or cultured species.

Demersal fish / Poissons démersaux,cgp_aafc,"Identification of ecological and biological significant areas (EBSA) in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence according to six groups of the food chain : primary production (Lavoie et al, 2007), secondary production (Plourde et McQuinn, 2010), meroplankton (Ouellet, 2007), benthic invertebrates (Chabot et al, 2007), demersal fishes (Castonguay et Valois, 2007) and pelagic fishes (McQuinn et al, 2012). The distribution area of each group has been evaluated using five criteria in order to determine the EBSA (DFO, 2004): 1. Uniqueness: Ranked from areas whose characteristics are unique, rare, distinct, and for which alternatives do not exist to areas whose characteristics are widespread with many areas which are similar. 2. Aggregation: Ranked from areas where most individuals of a species are aggregated to areas where individuals of the species are widespread 3. Fitness consequence: Ranked from areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make a major contribution to the fitness of the population or species present to areas where the life history activity(ies) undertaken make only marginal contributions to fitness. 4. Resilience: Ranked from areas where the habitat structures or species are highly sensitive, easily perturbed, and slow to recover to areas where the habitat structures or species are robust, resistant to perturbation, or readily return to the pre-perturbation state. 5. Naturalness: Ranked from areas which are pristine and characterized by native species to areas which are highly perturbed by anthropogenic activities and/or with high abundances of introduced or cultured species.

"Index Site Surveys Data for Olympia Oysters, Ostrea lurida, in British Columbia - 2009 to 2017",cgp_aafc,"The Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida Carpenter, 1864) is one of four species of oysters established in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and the only naturally occurring oyster in BC (Bourne 1997; Gillespie 1999, 2009). O. lurida reaches the northern limit of its range in the Central Coast of British Columbia at Gale Passage, Campbell Island, approximately 52°12'N, 128°24'W (Gillespie 2009). First Nations historically utilized Olympia oysters for food and their shells for ornamentation (Ellis and Swan 1981; Harbo 1997). European settlers harvested Olympia oysters commercially from the early 1800s until the early 1930s when stocks became depleted and the industry moved towards other larger, introduced oyster species (Bourne 1997; Quayle 1988). Since that time, Olympia oysters have likely maintained stable populations in BC, but have not recovered to abundance levels observed prior to the late 1800s (Gillespie 1999, 2009). Olympia oysters were designated a species of Special Concern by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2000 and 2010 and listed under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2003 (DFO 2009; COSEWIC 2011). A management plan was developed and posted to the SARA Public Registry in 2009 (DFO 2009). One of the objectives of this plan was to ensure maintenance of the relative abundance (density) of Olympia oyster at index sites. The plan also recommended development of a survey protocol for determining relative abundance (density) estimates. In response, a Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) Research Document was completed recommending a survey method for Olympia oysters (Norgard et al. 2010); a CSAS Science Advisory Report (DFO 2010) for selection of index sites was also completed. Thirteen index sites were chosen from a mixture of previously surveyed sites, and by random site selection. In 2014, a fourteenth site was added at Joes Bay in the Broken Group area in partnership with Parks Canada.

Sponge Fields in the Scotian Shelf (Western IIA Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the region as sampled by Western II A trawl gear in the Scotian Shelf biogeographic zone. A 2 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

"Critical Habitat for Species at Risk, British Columbia - Victoria's Owl-clover (Castilleja victoriae)",cgp_aafc,"This dataset displays the geographic areas within which critical habitat for species at risk listed on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) occurs in British Columbia. However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species' recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (""biophysical attributes"") that complete the definition of a species' critical habitat. Each species' dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both ""final"" and ""proposed"" critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. ""Proposed"" critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term ""final"", it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as ""grid squares"". These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species' recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat.

"Important areas of Blue Whale feeding, foraging and migration in eastern Canada",cgp_aafc,"The distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) is mainly dictated by key environmental drivers such as food requirements and availability, sea ice, and sometimes predation risks. It is common to find blue whales in upwelling regions, depending on topography (banks, slopes and shallow water) and thermal fronts, which are actually related to krill aggregations. Blue whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill) and have the highest absolute metabolic demands. A shapefile on the distribution of significant perennial areas of krill aggregation is available (DFO-ECCC). Important habitats for blue whales have therefore been identified by combining information on their distribution with krill aggregation areas (observed or predicted). In the waters of the St. Lawrence estuary, the presence of blue whales for foraging, feeding and migration has been observed throughout the year, with increased activity during the summer. It has been observed that feeding rates of blue whales are higher in shallow waters and during nocturnal periods (krill at surface), confirming that foraging near the surface is beneficial when possible. Their presence, their great fidelity to this important habitat for their activities and their behavior in the waters of the St. Lawrence in all seasons, show that blue whales are vulnerable to oil spills. They are vulnerable, not only indirectly through the reduction of prey and loss of suitable habitat, but also by their behavior requiring active activity on the surface and near the coast.. Additional Information The data used to create the polygons using the bounding box method comes from multiple sources of information: hunting records, photo-identification, coastal, airborne and boat surveys, passive acoustic monitoring, radio and satellite telemetry , ice trapping, anecdotal observations and modeling. The attribute table has been completed with the information contained in the following research document: Lesage, V., Gosselin, J-F., Lawson, J. W., McQuinn, I., Moors-Murphy, H., Plourde, S., Sears.

Protected Areas - Canada / Aires protégées - Canada,cgp_aafc,"Environment Canada's protected areas are prescribed a legal framework to facilitate the protection of wildlife and their habitat. Established according to biological criteria, these protected areas are primarily created for the purpose of conservation. Management activities may include interventions such as habitat restoration and investigative research projects on species and habitat. By conserving these habitats, Environment Canada's protected areas help ensure that wildlife species do not become at risk, thereby preserving biodiversity at regional, national and even international scales. Canada's protected areas represent a significant contribution to the protection of global biodiversity. There are over 4000 publicly and privately managed protected areas in Canada. Although ""parks"" are the most common type, protected areas are divided among more than 100 different types, ranging from ecological reserves and wilderness areas to community parks and conservation zones. Environment Canada's network of protected areas totals over 12.4 million hectares, with more than 85% of the network classified as wilderness areas under the IUCN protected areas management system. The Environment Canada's network of protected areas consist of 54 National Wildlife Areas and 92 Migratory Birds. For more information, visit: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6c343726-1e92-451a-876a-76e17d398a1c/Les airesprotégées d'Environnement Canada sont gérées par un cadre juridique pour faciliter la protection de la faune et de son habitat.Établies selon des critères biologiques, ces aires protégées sont essentiellement créées dans un objectif de conservation.Les activités de gestion peuvent comprendre des interventions comme les projets de restauration de l'habitat et de recherche d'enquête sur les espèces et l'habitat.En conservant ces habitats, les aires protégées d'Environnement Canada aident à empêcher que les espèces de la faune ne soient en péril, protégeant ainsi la biodiversité sur les plans régional, national et même international. Les aires protégées du Canada représentent une contribution considérable pour la protection de la biodiversitémondiale.On compte plus de 4 000 aires protégées publiques et privées au Canada.Même si les « parcs »sont le type le plus courant, les aires protégées sont réparties en plus de 100 différents types.Le réseau d'aires protégées d'Environnement Canada totalise plus de 12,4 millions d'hectares, dont plus de 85 % sont classés en zones de nature sauvage dans le cadre du système de gestion des aires protégées de l'Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN).Le réseau des aires protégées d'Environnement Canada comprend 54 réserves nationales de faune et 92 refuges d'oiseaux migrateurs.

The 928 records in the database represent 640 unique census plots located in all provinces and territories, except Prince Edward Island. The BBC, which was replaced by the current Breeding Bird Survey, is one of the longest-running surveys of bird populations in North America, and was designed to help determine abundance and distribution patterns of bird species. An important feature of the BBC Database is the habitat data associated with each census plot. The most prevalent vegetation species in different layers (canopy, shrub and ground cover) were recorded to reflect the assumption that birds respond principally to vegetative structure.

Relative occurrence of Atlantic Wolffish in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence,cgp_aafc,"Spatial distribution of the relative occurrence of Atlantic Wolffish in the annual DFO groundfish research surveys conducted by the Québec (1978-2008) and Gulf (1971-2008) regions. Catch and effort data were aggregated by 100 km² cells. The probability of catching an Atlantic Wolffish in a set and within a cell (relative occurrence) was calculated as the ratio of the number of sets in which a species was recorded and the total number of sets made. This method allows the mapping of catch and effort for numerous time series based on data from different programs in both the whole study area (research surveys and Sentinel Fisheries using bottom trawls and a random stratified design) or in specific areas within the Gulf.

"Atlantic salmon smolt data from the Restigouche River, New Brunswick",cgp_aafc,"Each year, rotary screw traps (smolt wheels) are installed in the Kedgwick River, Upsalquitch River and main Restigouche channel from early/mid May to mid/late June. All traps are checked daily, and all fish species are counted. The majority of Atlantic salmon smolts are measured and a fraction are weighted. Everyday, Atlantic salmon smolts are tagged with unique streamer tags and released upstream of the trap they were caught in with the hope that a fraction of them will be recaptured so the trap efficiency and abundance can be estimated (capture-mark-recapture experiment).

Large Gorgonian Coral Fields in the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelves (Campelen Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify large gorgonian coral fields from the broader distribution of large gorgonian corals in the region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Newfoundland - Labrador Shelves biogeographic zone. A 0.3 kg minimum threshold for the large gorgonian coral catch was identified as the weight that separated the large gorgonian field habitat from the broader distribution of large gorgonian corals with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Known and exploited scallop beds in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence,cgp_aafc,"Iceland and sea Scallops (Chlamys islandica and Placopecten magellanicus) represent an important biological resource for commercial fisheries and coastal ecology. The beds of this layer are described as being known and commercially exploited historically and / or currently, and have undergone validation and delimitation treatment with a good degree of precision. They are located in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the North Shore, Anticosti, the North Shore of Gaspésie and the Magdalen Islands. The beds are considered among the most abundant beds of scallops used for commercial fishing (noteworthy: high densities and fishing activity do not strictly stick to these beds). They are known to be vulnerable mainly during the larval growth period from August to November for larval survival, but remain vulnerable all year long, being sessile species. The data layer contains information on the total area of the beds, the fishing zones and fishery bottoms (validation step in lineage), the name of the beds and the breeding periods and fishing periods (valid in 2015) by sector. Additional Information The scallop beds in this data layer have been determined from these three sources of information: research surveys (since 1977, annual alternating sectors since 2009), exploratory fisheries (2000, 2001, 2003) and commercial fisheries (annual). The beds in this layer have a higher degree of precision within the known fishing zones and bottoms in the Côte-Nord and Anticosti sectors, Gaspésie and the Magdalen Islands . They represent the important beds known and exploited historically. They do not represent the general distribution of the species, do not take into account the large unexploited beds of scallops or exploited beds whose delimitation work has not yet been specified. It is the most precise up-to-date data. Sea and Iceland scallops are found mainly at shallow depths in the coastal environment (from 20 to 80 m depending on the area) on gravel, shells or rocks. The deposits are usually associated with the presence of larval retention zones, and are vulnerable during the larval growth period (5 weeks) between August and November.

Presence 2009 to/à 2018,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish group richness in the Estuary and Gulf of St.Lawrence estimated by the number of species found in each grid cell 10 km x 10 km. Input data are from the annual August and September multidisciplinary surveys. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

West Coast Vancouver Island Synoptic Bottom Trawl Survey,cgp_aafc,"Catch, effort, location (latitude, longitude), relative abundance indices, and associated biological data from groundfish multi-species bottom trawl surveys in West Coast Vancouver Island. Introduction The West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) synoptic bottom trawl survey was first conducted in 2004, and has been repeated every second year since. This survey is one of a set of long-term and coordinated surveys that together cover the continental shelf and upper slope of most of the British Columbia coast. The other surveys are the Queen Charlotte Sound (QCS) survey, the Hecate Strait (HS) survey, the West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) survey, and the Strait of Georgia (SOG) survey. The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery-independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The survey follows a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Data from these surveys are also presented in the groundfish data synopsis report (Anderson et al. 2019). Effort This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (""trace"" amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index. The groundfish data synopsis report (Anderson et al. 2019) provides an explanation of how the relative biomass indices are derived.

The objectives of these surveys are to provide fishery independent abundance indices of all demersal fish species available to bottom trawling and to collect biological samples of selected species. The surveys follow a random depth-stratified design and the sampling units are 2 km by 2 km blocks. The synoptic bottom trawl surveys are conducted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society (CGRCS), a non-profit society composed of participants in the British Columbia commercial groundfish trawl fishery. The Queen Charlotte Sound and West Coast Haida Gwaii surveys are conducted under collaborative agreements, with the CGRCS providing chartered commercial fishing vessels and field technicians, while DFO provides in-kind contributions for running the surveys including personnel and equipment. The Hecate Strait, West Coast Vancouver Island, and Strait of Georgia surveys are conducted by DFO and have typically taken place on the Canadian Coast Guard research vessel W.E. Ricker. In years when the W.E. Ricker has not been available, the Hecate Strait and West Coast Vancouver Island surveys have taken place on chartered industry vessels. Effort This table contains information about the survey trips and fishing events (trawl tows/sets) that are part of this survey series. Trip-level information includes the year the survey took place, a unique trip identifier, the vessel that conducted the survey, and the trip start and end dates (the dates the vessel was away from the dock conducting the survey). Set-level information includes the date, time, location, and depth that fishing took place, as well as information that can be used to calculate fishing effort (duration) and swept area. All successful fishing events are included, regardless of what was caught. Catch This table contains the catch information from successful fishing events. Catches are identified to species or to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Most catches are weighed, but some are too small (""trace"" amounts) or too large (e.g. very large Big Skate). The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that catches can be related to the fishing event information (including capture location). Biology This table contains the available biological data for catches which were sampled. Data may include any or all of length, sex, weight, age. Different length types are measured depending on the species. Age structures are collected when possible for species where validated aging methods exist and are archived until required for an assessment; therefore, all existing structures have not been aged at this time. The unique trip identifier and set number are included so that samples can be related to the fishing event and catch information. Biomass This table contains relative biomass indices of species that have been captured in every survey of the time series. The coefficient of variation and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are provided for each index. The report on the 2012 Strait of Georgia Survey (King et al. 2013) provides an explanation of how the relative indices are derived.

"Critical Habitat for Species at Risk, British Columbia - Vesper Sparrow affinis subspecies (Pooecetes gramineus affinis)",cgp_aafc,"This dataset displays the geographic areas within which critical habitat for species at risk listed on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) occurs in British Columbia. However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species' recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (""biophysical attributes"") that complete the definition of a species' critical habitat. Each species' dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both ""final"" and ""proposed"" critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. ""Proposed"" critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term ""final"", it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as ""grid squares"". These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species' recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. Critical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species"".

Copper Redhorse critical habitat in Quebec,cgp_aafc,"The Copper Redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi) is the only fish whose distribution is exclusively restricted to Quebec. This range is restricted even further to the St. Lawrence River and some of its tributaries. This layer represents the Copper Redhorse critical habitat defined by the analysis of available knowledge and a scientific advice. Purpose The Copper Redhorse population is in decline due to several threats like habitat degradation, construction of dams, contaminants, exotic or introduced species, recreational activities, commercial fishery, and low water levels. Furthermore, certain biological characteristics of the Copper Redhorse contribute to its vulnerability. The Copper Redhorse population was officialy listed as endangered in Schedule I of the Species at Risk Act in December 2007. Additional Information Critical habitat for the Copper Redhorse has been identified to the extent possible, based on the best available information. Two workshops held in 2009 and 2010 by Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Ministère des Ressources Naturelles et de la Faune du Québec, allowed to review the information and take note of the new data to identify habitat use by the Copper Redhorse in the St. Lawrence and Richelieu rivers and later in the Rivière des Prairies and Rivière des Milles Îles. Adult feeding habitat in the St. Lawrence River between Lake Saint-Louis and Lake Saint-Pierre, was identified using modeling based on the telemetric monitoring of habitat use and on twelve habitat variables (for example: depth, current velocity, vegetation density). Also, recent telemetry and historic data confirmed the use of the lower stretches of the Rivière des Prairies and Rivière des Mille Îles. Critical adult feeding habitat is consequently identified as habitat in the fluvial reach between Montreal and Sorel presenting favorable characteristics for the copper redhorse, used in the model.

Sponge Fields in the Gulf (Western IIA Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the Southern Gulf region as sampled by Western II A gear in the Gulf biogeographic zone. A 3 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Phytoplankton counts and oceanographic conditions at the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) stations,cgp_aafc,"Phytoplankton species abundance (cell/L) and oceanographic conditions (temperature, salinity, chlorophylle-a (mg/m³) for some years and nutrient content (mmol/m³)) at stations of the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) from1994 to 2016. The layer presents the station positions of the HAMP. Two files are attached to each station: one containing the cell counts and the second the oceanographic conditions. Purpose The summer growth of many toxic and harmful microalgae species poses a serious threat for the public health and commercial or recreational exploitation of some marine species. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) initiated the Harmful Algae Monitoring Programme (HAMP) in 1989 in order to complete the monitoring program for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Under the responsibility of Maurice-Lamontagne Institute scientists, the HAMP is to monitor, by means of a coastal station network, the natural occurrence of toxic and harmful algae in the St. Lawrence in order to determine their spatio-temporal distribution and the environmental conditions leading to their bloom. The network is made up of 11 coastal stations which are sampled every week from April to November and which are established along Quebec eastern shores. It extends from Tadoussac to Tête-à-la-Baleine on the St. Lawrence north shore and from Sainte-Flavie to Carleton on the south shore along the Gaspé peninsula. Another station is located in Havre-Aux-Maisons, Magdalen Islands. The HAMP was discontinued in 2010 but opportunistic samplings are still done at some stations. Additional information The sampling and analysis protocol is described in details in the following publication apart from the fact that the number of identified and counted species significantly has been increasing with time. Phytoplankton samples are preserved in a lugol solution. Blasco D., M. Levasseur, R. Gélinas, R. Larocque, A.D. Cembella, B. Huppertz et E. Bonneau.1998.

Southern British Columbia Chinook Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013.

Beluga whale critical habitat in the Saguenay River and the St. Lawrence Estuary,cgp_aafc,"The Beluga whale critical habitat, which includes the Upper Estuary, the Saguenay River up to Sainte-Marguerite Bay, and the southern channel of the Lower Estuary, supports the vital functions of calving and rearing of the young. Due to the lack of information, studies are planned in the near future to increase knowledge of the species. Critical habitat actual limitations could change someday. Purpose The beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population in the St. Lawrence Estuary was greatly reduced by hunting, which was finally banned in the St. Lawrence in 1979. In May 2005, this beluga population was officially listed as a threatened species on SARA's List of Wildlife Species at Risk. Additional Information St. Lawrence beluga critical habitat is identified using the best available information. All the available information on its prey, seasonal distribution, use and characteristics of its habitat has been reviewed by Mosnier (2010). This literature review was used to produce a science advisory report reviewed by marine mammal experts. Beluga whale critical habitat has been identified with the information and the scientific advice, using the area of occupancy approach and corresponds to the summer distribution of groups made up of adults and new-born calves and juveniles.

Known and exploited Stimpson's surfclam beds in Quebec coastal waters,cgp_aafc,"Stimpson's surfclam is under protection and conservation measures to protect its reproductive potential and the integrity of the population (beds) in the Quebec region. The beds of this layer are described as being known and commercially exploited historically and / or currently and have undergone validation and delineation processing with a good degree of precision. They are located in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the North Shore and the Magdalen Islands. The beds of this layer are considered among the most abundant in Stimpson's surfclams and used for commercial fishing (note: the high densities are not strictly found in these beds). They are mainly recognized as vulnerable during the breeding season from June to July. There may be secondary spawning in the fall as well. The data layer contains information on the total area each bed's polygon, the areas and names of the beds, the target sectors, and the breeding and fishing periods. Additional Information Exploratory fishing for Stimpson's surfclam began in 1990 in the Magdalen Islands and in 1991 on the North Shore of Quebec. Since 1993, commercial fishing activity has steadily increased and yielded up to 785 tons of Stimpson's surfclam in Quebec (2014). Stimpson's surfclam is a sessile bivalve mollusc and a strong burrower in sandy sediments in the subtidal zone. Maximum densities are found between 15-20 m on the North Shore and between 25-60 m in the Magdalen Islands. The surfclam has a long lifetime, slow growth rate and therefore, low productivity. A sedentary lifestyle, irregular recruitment and slow growth rates are factors that make this species vulnerable to stock depletion and spills. The known distribution of Stimpson's surfclam is based on several sources of information: exploratory fisheries, scientific surveys and fishermen's logbooks. Commercial fishery data come from three distinct sources of information: the purchase receipt, fishermen's logbook and sampling of the commercial catch by DFO. More than 25 beds are distributed along the North Shore of the Lower Estuary from Les Escoumins to Blanc-Sablon (Qc). Four beds are known and surround the Magdalen Islands.

Community Aquatic Monitoring Program (CAMP) data for the Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence Dataset,cgp_aafc,"Each summer, environmental community groups collect important data to determine if groupings of fish, shrimp and crab - what is called a community- can be used as an indicator of the health status of bays and estuaries. Sampling was conducted from May through September for the first years then from June through August. In 2018 and 2019, the sampling was conducted just once in each estuary. Community group members and staff sample six stations once a month in their designated estuary. Fish, shrimps and crabs are collected with a beach seine net and later released live back to the water once identified and counted. From this, the community groups provide important information to Fisheries and Oceans Canada, including: -identification and numbers of fish, shrimp and crab species; -water conditions and samples; -information on aquatic plants; -sediment samples. With this information, Fisheries and Oceans Canada scientists working with government agencies and universities can conduct analyses to determine the suitability of indicators to assess the health of bays and estuaries.

Large Gorgonian Coral Fields in the Eastern Arctic (Campelen Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify large gorgonian coral fields from the broader distribution of large gorgonian corals in the region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Eastern Arctic biogeographic zone. A 15 kg minimum threshold for the large gorgonian coral catch was identified as the weight that separated the large gorgonian field habitat from the broader distribution of large gorgonian corals with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Sci. 2916: vii + 72 pages. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/342703.pdf Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

Sci. 2916: vii + 72 pages. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/342703.pdf Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990. Protocols for Research Vessel Cruises within the Gulf Region (Demersal Fish) (1970-1987). Can. MS Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. No. 2082: 143p. The sampling protocols used for the Estuary and northern Gulf surveys are described in details in the following publications: Bourdages, H., Archambault, D., Bernier, B., Fréchet, A., Gauthier, J., Grégoire, F., Lambert, J., et Savard, L. 2010.

Chum Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013. Please be aware that CUs may be reviewed and are subject to change without notice.

The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013.

Lake Type Sockeye Salmon CU Boundary,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units.

Boreal Felt Lichen (Erioderma pedicellatum) - Critical Habitat for Species at Risk - Atlantic Canada (Nova Scotia),cgp_aafc,"This dataset displays the geographic areas within which critical habitat for terrestrial species at risk, listed on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), occurs in Atlantic Canada: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador. Note that this includes only terrestrial species and species for which Environment and Climate Change Canada is the lead. However, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with the information provided in a species' recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (""biophysical attributes"") that complete the definition of a species' critical habitat. Each species' dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data for all terrestrial species in Atlantic Canada that is available for download. The collection includes critical habitat as it is depicted in final recovery documents. It is important to note that recovery documents, and therefore critical habitat, may be amended from time to time. Also, new species can be added to Schedule 1 of SARA and thus new critical habitat described when additional recovery documents are posted on the SAR Public Registry. As critical habitat is amended, this dataset will be updated; however the SAR Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca) should always be considered the definitive source for critical habitat information. Critical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as ""the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species"". Critical habitat identification alone is not an automatic ""protection"" designation. Federal or non-federal laws or bylaws may be in place to provide protection.

Sci. 2916: vii + 72 pages. http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/342703.pdf Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

Sponge Fields in the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelves (Campelen Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify sponge grounds from the broader distribution of sponges in the region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Newfoundland - Labrador Shelves biogeographic zone. A 200 kg minimum threshold for the sponge catch was identified as the weight that separated the sponge ground habitat from the broader distribution of sponges with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - High Arctic,cgp_aafc,"The High Arctic dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area is located in the High Arctic Archipelago and contains both marine and terrestrial components. The boundaries of the study area are based on the NOGB leasing grids applied in the High Arctic, under which exploration, significant discovery and production licenses may be issued. The Sverdrup Basin (and Lancaster Sound) has the highest known oil and gas potential of the sedimentary basins of the Arctic Islands (Nunavut Planning Commission 2000) and it is expected that there is oil and gas potential on Melville Island and Bathurst Island (Sivummut Economic Development Strategy Group 2003). To date, no gas has been produced, and 321,470 m³ of oil has been produced from the Bent Horn oil field (Morrell et al. 1995).

Additional information The MICS (Mingan Island Cetacean Study) has been collecting and compiling in a photo-identification catalogue, blue whale (and other type of whales) sightings for the western North Atlantic since 1979. Since 1987, the material and sampling protocol has been being relatively stable, neither random nor systematic. Field work is conducted abord inflatable boats. Because the whole Gulf ot St. Lawrence cannot be thoroughly studied, MCIS conducts surveys in known whale aggregation areas. The spatial effort is also weather dependent and is mainly constrained by wind direction and strength. Therefore, the study area is not homogeneously covered. Each whale observation is associated with a picture that allows individual identification based on the animal's pigmentation pattern.

Sea Pen Fields in the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelves (Campelen Trawl Sample),cgp_aafc,"Polygons denoting concentrations of sea pens, small and large gorgonian corals and sponges on the east coast of Canada have been identified through spatial analysis of research vessel survey by-catch data following an approach used by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) in the Regulatory Area (NRA) on Flemish Cap and southeast Grand Banks. Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify sea pen fields from the broader distribution of sea pens in the region as sampled by Campelen trawl gear in the Newfoundland - Labrador Shelves biogeographic zone. A 0.4 kg minimum threshold for the sea pen catch was identified as the weight that separated the sea pen field habitat from the broader distribution of sea pens with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Nearshore Bottom Patches for  Pacific Canada. Version 1.0,cgp_aafc,"The shallow, coastal regions of the world's oceans are highly productive ecosystems providing important habitat for commercial, forage, endangered, and iconic species. Given the diversity of ecosystem services produced or supported by this ecosystem, a better understanding of its structure and function is central to developing an ecosystem-based approach to management. However this region termed the 'white strip' by marine geologists because of the general lack of high-resolution bathymetric data - is dynamic, highly variable, and difficult to access making data collection challenging and expensive. Since substrate is a key indicator of habitat in this important ecosystem, we created a continuous substrate map of Bottom Patches (BoPs) from the best available bottom type data using an approach that is simple, quantitative, and transparent making it amenable to iterative improvement as data quality and availability improve. To provide subsequent analyses (such as habitat models) with some confidence in the defined bottom type values, we developed a corresponding confidence surface based on the agreement of, and distance between observations. Such data are critical to assessments of species distributions and anthropogenic risk. Bottom patches (BoPs) have been created to represent bottom type for the entire Pacific Canadian coast from the high high water line to a depth of 50 m. As a polygon representation, the BoPs describe patches of similar substrate prescribed by depth classes and the available field observations. In the areas where no observations are available, predicted bottom type values are used. The approach is described in Gregr et al. (2013), as a spatial framework for representing nearshore ecosystems. Accuracy of the bottom type depends on a multitude of factors but primarily the reliability and density of the bottom type observations. The horizontal accuracy of these data likely ranges from metres to 10s of m because of the source data or data processing required. Areas with a higher data density, where the data show strong coherence, are understood to have higher accuracy. The BoPs use depth ribbons (polygons describing bathymetric ecozones) as an input. Depth ribbons for Pacific Canada were created from a high resolution (20 x 20 m2) bathymetry. Given the resolution of these data, processing was facilitated by dividing the Pacific Coast into 5 regions. The West Coast of Vancouver Island, extending from Cape Sutil in the North past Port San Juan to the South, includes a total of 110,313 BoP polygons. Bottom Patches for Queen Charlotte Strait and Strait of Georgia regions were combined for a total of 235,754 BoP polygons. The North Central Coast region, extending from the Alaskan border in the North to Cape Caution in the South, includes a total of 431,639 BoP polygons. The Haida Gwaii region includes a total of 86,825 BoP polygons. These data are intended for scientific research only.

Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - Eastern Arctic,cgp_aafc,"The Eastern Arctic dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area is located east of Baffin Island, Nunavut and encompasses marine habitat in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. The boundaries of the study area are based on NOGB leasing grids applied in the Eastern Arctic, under which exploration and production licenses may be issued. Although portions of the study area hold high oil and gas potential and several small oil fields and substantial reserves of gas have been found since the 1960s in the north Baffin region, exploration for oil and gas has been limited to seismic operations and geological field work.

Critical habitat of the St. Lawrence estuary population of Striped Bass,cgp_aafc,"Striped Bass critical habitat (St. Lawrence estuary population) defined by the analysis of available knowledge in 2011 and a scientific advice. Purpose The status of the Striped Bass population of the St. Lawrence Estuary is in constant evolution. It went from indigenous population until the end of 1960 to designated extirpated in Canada under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2011. Still in 2011, the status of the population of the St. Lawrence Estuary was reassessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) following the Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune du Québec re-introduction efforts and was designated endangered (COSEWIC 2012). Under SARA, critical habitat must be designated for all threatened, endangered or extirpated species. Additional Information The analysis of available knowledge on habitat quality assessment and its use by the Striped Bass was realized using two research documents: Pelletier et al.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures. These polygons identify sea pen fields from the broader distribution of sea pens in the region as sampled by Western II A trawl gear in the Scotian Shelf biogeographic zone. A 0.1 kg minimum threshold for the sea pen catch was identified as the weight that separated the sea pen field habitat from the broader distribution of sea pens with these research vessel tow data and gear type.

Chinook Salmon CU Status,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS). The term ""escapement"" is used to refer to the group of mature salmon that have 'escaped' from various sources of exploitation, and returned to freshwater to spawn and reproduce. This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013. Please be aware that CUs may be reviewed and are subject to change without notice.

This data is assigned to a ""Counting Site"", which may be a complete watercourse with a marine terminus, a tributary to a larger watercourse, or a defined reach within a watercourse that may or may not encompass the entire population but represents an index of the abundance of that population. CU Status: CUs form the basic unit for assessment under Canada's Policy for the Conservation of Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (DFO 2005). The biological status of a CU is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009), which indicate a WSP status zone: Red (poor status), Amber (marginal status), or Green (healthy status). A final step then incorporates all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, along with expert commentary to support the final status determination (e.g., DFO 2012; DFO 2016). This information is used as inputs to fisheries management processes to help prioritize assessment activities and management actions. Note: The CUs were last updated in August 2013. Please be aware that CUs may be reviewed and are subject to change without notice.

Chinook Salmon CU Counting Sites,cgp_aafc,"A Conservation Unit (CU) is a group of wild Pacific salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations. Holtby and Ciruna (2007) provided a framework for aggregating the five species of salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) found on Canada's Pacific coast into species-specific CUs based on three primary characteristics: ecotypology, life history and genetics. The first stage in the description of the Conservation Units is based solely on ecology. The ecotypologies used in this framework include a combined characterization of both freshwater and near-shore marine environments, and is termed ""joint adaptive zone"". The second stage of the description involves the use of life history, molecular genetics, and further ecological characterizations to group and partition the first stage units into the final Conservation Units. The result is CUs that are described through the joint application of all three axes. It is important to note that CUs are distinct from other aggregates of Pacific salmon, such as designatable units (DUs) under the Species at Risk Act or management units (MUs). CU Counting Sites: Salmon spawner enumeration data in the Pacific Region is stored and managed in the New Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS).

MaineDEP Eelgrass 2013 (Casco Bay Only),Maine Department of Environmental Protection | John.Lynam@maine.gov_maine,"Maine's eelgrass meadows form an important marine and estuarine coastal aquatic habitat for the state. Along with other plants, eelgrass forms the base of food production in the sea. Eelgrass provides shelter for juvenile fish, and invertebrates, is a site for primary settlement of the larvae of some bivalve mollusks, and in certain locations helps to stabilize unconsolidated sediments and shorelines. In August 2013, Casco Bay was flown and photographed. Photography was timed near low tides with low wind velocity, good water clarity, and maximum biomass of eelgrass. These factors aid in the detection of the subtidal portion a bed. Polygons delineating stands of eelgrass were screen digitized and coded using a four category scale of percent cover. Cover Class values: 1 = 0% to 10% cover, 2 = 10% to 40% cover, 3 = 40% to 70% cover, 4 = 70% to 100% cover. Verification was carried out by boat, on foot, and by plane. Though dense patches of eelgrass approximately 6 meters in diameter and less can be identified under good conditions and in some cases were mapped, a conservative estimate of the minimum mapping unit is 150 square meters. This represents a stand of approximately 14 meters in diameter.",Feature Layer,"August 17, 2020","1,056","['MaineDEP', 'biota', 'dep', 'eelgrass', 'environment', 'Maine DEP', 'Maine Department of Environmental Protection', 'state of maine', 'BIOLOGY', 'coastal', 'submerged aquatic vegetation', 'Zostera marina', 'oceans', 'habitat', 'Maine', 'GeoLibrary']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::mainedep-eelgrass-2013-casco-bay-only,2020-08-17

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

ICELUS BICORNIS S,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

SCAPHTHALMUS AQUOSUS N,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

GYMNELUS VIRIDIS N,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol.

HEMITRIPTERUS AMERICANUS S,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

HEMITRIPTERUS AMERICANUS N,cgp_aafc,"2009 to 2018 demersal fish abundance in the Estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990.

The abundance is expressed as a number of individuals per normalized trawl set. Each species is individually represented in the northern Gulf and in the southern Gulf. Input data are from the annual August (North) and September (South) multidisciplinary surveys. The demersal species represented are: Alewife, Alligatorfish, American Plaice, Arctic Alligatorfish, Arctic Hookear Sculpin, Arctic Shanny, Arctic Staghorn Sculpin, Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Eelpout, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Hookear Sculpin, Atlantic Poacher, Atlantic Spiny Lumpsucker, Atlantic Wolffish, Black Dogfish, Blacksnout Seasnail, Brill/Windowpane, Common Grenadier, Common Wolf Eel, Cunner, Daubed Shanny, Esmark's Eelpout, Fish Doctor, Fourbeard Rockling, Fourline Snakeblenny, Greenland Cod, Greenland Halibut, Haddock, Longfin Hake, Longhorn Sculpin, Lowfin Snailfish, Monkfish, Goosefish, Moustache Sculpin, Newfoundland Eelpout, Northern Hagfish, Ocean Pout, Rockfishes, Sea Sculpin, Sea Tadpole, Shorthorn Sculpin, Smooth Skate, Snakeblenny, Spatulate Sculpin, Spiny Dogfish, Spinytail Skate, Spotted Wolffish, Stout Eelblenny, Thorny Skate, Twohorn Sculpin, Vahl's Eelpout, Variegated Snailfish, White Hake, Winter Flounder, Winter Skate, Witch Flounder, Wolf Eelpout, Wrymouth and Yellowtail Flounder. Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling.

Purpose Since 1990, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans has been conducting an annual multidisciplinary survey in the Estuary and northern Gulf of St. Lawrence using a standardized protocol. In the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, these bottom trawl surveys has been carrying out each September since 1971. These missions are an important source of information about the status of the marine ressources. The objectives of the surveys are multiple: to estimate the abundance and biomass of groundfish and invertebrates, to identify the spatial distribution and biological characteristics of these species, to monitor the biodiversity of the Estuary and Gulf and finally, to describe the environmental conditions observed in the area at the moment of the sampling. The southern Gulf surveys are realized using the following standardized protocol: Hurlbut,T. and D.Clay (eds) 1990. Protocols for Research Vessel Cruises within the Gulf Region (Demersal Fish) (1970-1987). Can. MS Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. No. 2082: 143p.

Maine Roseate Tern Essential Habitat Layer,Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife | Jason.Czapiga@maine.gov_maine,"Essential Wildlife Habitats are areas currently or historically providing physical or biological features essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species in Maine and which may require special management considerations. As required under the Maine Endangered Species Act, a state agency or municipal government shall not permit, license, fund or carry out projects that will significantly alter an Essential Habitat or violate protection guidelines adopted for the habitat. Landowners, project planners, municipalities or state agencies considering a project in or near an Essential Habitat should immediately contact an MDIFW Regional Wildlife Biologist for assistance. Essential Wildlife Habitat pertains only to definitions under Maine's endangered species laws (12 MRSA, Chapter 713, Subchapter V, Sections 7754 and 7755-A) and regulations (MDIFW Rules, Chapter 8.05). Information about and mapped locations of other endangered and threatened species habitats, ""Significant Wildlife Habitat"" (38 MRSA, Chapter 3, Subchapter 1, Section 480-B).   Roseate tern (ROST) essential habitat (EH) focuses on nesting areas to maintain breeding habitat and prevent disturbance that may cause nesting failure.  A ""Nesting Area"" is a locality encompassing all or part of an island used by at least one pair of nesting roseate terns.  ""Nesting"" means the presence of one or more nests, eggs, chicks, or pairs of territorial adult terns between May 15 and August 15.  To be identified and mapped as EH, the nest area must: (a) have a record of at least one pair of nesting ROST since 1930; (b) have suitable habitat as indicated by the presence of nesting common, arctic, or roseate terns in at least any 3 years since 1976; and (c) be considered essential to the achievement of MDIFW's management goals and objectives for roseate terns.",Feature Layer,"July 6, 2020",22,"['Maine', 'MaineIFW', 'MDIFW', 'Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife', 'geolibrary', 'biota', 'environment', 'Roseate Tern', 'Essential Habitat']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/maine::maine-roseate-tern-essential-habitat-layer,2020-07-06
MaineDMR Sea Run Fisheries - Current and Potential Alewife Spawning Habitat,State of Maine | William.DeVoe@maine.gov_maine,"For a layer file linking directly to this item for use in ArcGIS Desktop clients, see the DMR GIS Layer Links group.The Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is an anadromous (sea-run) fish, native to Maine, that spends the majority of its life at sea but returns to freshwater to spawn. Alewife typically return to their natal habitat to spawn, although they do exhibit some straying.  The alewife historically was very abundant in Maine, supported large fisheries, and spawned in lakes or ponds that were not too great a distance from the ocean (≤ 200 miles) or were above an insurmountable falls (Atkins 1887).  Maine’s newly appointed Commissioners of Fisheries surveyed fisheries in the State’s major river systems and concluded that the decline of anadromous species was caused by impassable dams, overfishing, and pollution of the water (Foster and Atkins 1867).  Impassable dams remain a problem for anadromous species today.   The Maine Department of Marine Resources (MDMR) is a cabinet level agency of the State of Maine.  MDMR was established to regulate, conserve, and develop marine, estuarine, and diadromous fish resources; to conduct and sponsor scientific research; to promote and develop marine coastal industries; to advise and cooperate with state, local, and federal officials concerning activities in coastal waters; and to implement, administer, and enforce the laws and regulations necessary for these purposes.  MDMR is the lead state agency in the restoration and management of diadromous (anadromous and catadromous) species of fishes, and its policy is to restore Maine’s native diadromous fish to their historical habitat.  MDMR accomplishes restoration by ensuring there is safe, timely, and effective upstream and downstream passage at dams, and, in most cases, by stocking fish in spawning habitat prior to passage being completed.  This layer consists of the lakes, ponds, and flowages (lentic habitat) that are current and potential Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) spawning habitat.  The layer does not include bodies of water above a known natural barrier, for example, an impassable falls.  The 417 lakes, ponds, and flowages have been organized into six categories, which are defined below.  The layer also does not include bodies of water in Maine that are in the St. John River watershed, an international watershed that originates in Canada and is part of the international boundary in northern Maine.     Accessible established There are no impassible anthropomorphic barriers (dams, culverts) that prevent access to this habitat, and the State agencies (MDMR, MDIFW) or their partners (USFWS, NMFS, NERR) have documented a population of spawning alewife in the last 5-10 years (2010-2020).  Dams have operating upstream and downstream fish passage facilities and culverts meet MDOT standards.  Accessible stocked Upstream and downstream fish passage has recently been provided or improved at anthropomorphic barriers (via removal or fishways), and MDMR is currently stocking spawning habitat with Alewife to establish a viable population.    Accessible unknown There are no anthropomorphic barriers that prevent access to this spawning habitat, but a population of spawning alewife has not been documented by the agencies or partners in the last 5-10 years typically because this habitat has not been sampled.  Inaccessible stocked One or more anthropomorphic barriers prevent access to the habitat that MDMR is currently stocking with Alewife to initiate or maintain a population prior to upstream and downstream fish passage being provided.  If the barriers include federally licensed hydropower facilities, the stocking may be needed to be continued for years.   Inaccessible One or more anthropomorphic barriers prevent access to upstream spawning habitat.   Inaccessible unknown One or more anthropomorphic barriers prevent access to the upstream spawning habitat, and the upstream range of the alewife in the river system in unknown.

Saskatchewan Woodland Caribou Ranges and Administration Units,Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment | Saskatchewan.Government,"Saskatchewan’s boreal woodland caribou range is divided into two woodland caribou conservation units, based on the boundaries of the boreal ecozones. The Boreal Shield (SK1) Woodland Caribou Conservation Unit (hereafter called Boreal Shield or SK1) encompasses the rocky shield, sandy plains and many lakes of northern Saskatchewan. The Boreal Plain (SK2) Woodland Caribou Conservation Unit (hereafter called Boreal Plain or SK2) encompasses the more productive mixed-wood forests and lakes of central Saskatchewan, including large areas of low-lying peatlands. While these two units represent important differences in ecological conditions (e.g., habitat types, fire regimes, landforms, etc.) and human land use and management (e.g., overall levels and types of land use, fire management, etc.), the boundary between SK1 and SK2 does not represent a population boundary, as caribou move freely between the two areas.The large size of the SK2 woodland caribou conservation unit (i.e., 109,717 km2) is not well suited for range assessment and range planning activities, given the large variation in ecological conditions, habitat types, land use, and natural disturbance regimes across the Boreal Plain of Saskatchewan. As a result, three smaller caribou administration units within SK2 were developed: SK2 East, SK2 Central and SK2 West. SK2 West is further subdivided into two smaller management subunits.At present, the SK1 area has not been sub-divided into administration units.

Seagrass Habitat in Florida,Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute | GISLibrarian,"This polygon GIS data set represents a compilation of statewide seagrass data from various source agencies and scales. The data were mapped from sources ranging in date from 1987 to 2018. Not all data in this compilation are mapped from photography; some are the results of field measurements. See the ""Sources"" section for more information. The original source data sets were not all classified in the same manner; some used the Florida Land Use Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCCS) codes 9113 for discontinuous seagrass and 9116 for continuous seagrass; some defined only presence and absence of seagrass, and some defined varying degrees of seagrass percent cover. In order to merge all of these data sources into one compilation data set, FWRI reclassified the various source data attribute schemes into two categories: ""Continuous Seagrass"" and ""Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass"". In areas where studies overlap, the most recent study where a given area has been interpreted is represented in this data set. This data set is not comparable to previous statewide data sets for time series studies - not all areas have been updated since the previous statewide compilation and some areas previously not mapped are now included.

Kernel density analysis was used to identify high concentrations and the area occupied by successive catch weight thresholds was used to identify aggregations. These analyses were performed for each of the five biogeographic zones of eastern Canada. The largest sea pen fields were found in the Laurentian Channel as it cuts through the Gulf of St. Lawrence, while large gorgonian coral forests were found in the Eastern Arctic and on the northern Labrador continental slope. Large ball-shaped Geodia spp. sponges were located along the continental slopes north of the Grand Banks, while on the Scotian Shelf a unique population of the large barrel-shaped sponge Vazella pourtalesi was identified. The latitude and longitude marking the positions of all tows which form these and other dense aggregations are provided along with the positions of all tows which captured black coral, a non-aggregating taxon which is long-lived and vulnerable to fishing pressures.

The minimum period is from one winter, through the following summer, and into the next winter; however, most permafrost has existed for much longer. This formal definition considers only the temperature of the ground, and thus permafrost is a strictly thermal phenomenon, and not a material. At temperatures below 0° C , almost all of the soil moisture occurs in the form of ground ice. Ground ice usually exists at temperature close to its melting point and so is liable to melt if the ground warms. The extent and nature of permafrost, including estimated ice content and typical ground ice forms are derived from the map ""Canada - Permafrost"" (Natural Resources Canada, 1995).",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",213,"['Terrestrial ecosystems', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystems', 'AAFC', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', '4baa66ad-aa29-4233-a6a8-7f5cbefb5ea8']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/7cf7dfa52c8c45428e89e3e1c43e4a0e_33,2020-03-12

To precisely define what constitutes critical habitat for a particular species it is essential that this geo-spatial information be considered in conjunction with complementary information provided in a species’ recovery document. Recovery documents are available from the Species at Risk (SAR) Public Registry (http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca). The recovery documents contain important information about the interpretation of the geo-spatial information, especially regarding the biological and environmental features (“biophysical attributes”) that complete the definition of a species’ critical habitat. Each species’ dataset is part of a larger collection of critical habitat data that is available for download. The collection includes both “final” and “proposed” critical habitat as it is depicted in the recovery documents. “Proposed” critical habitat depicted in proposed recovery documents has not been formally identified and is subject to change before it is posted as final. Despite the use of the term “final”, it is important to note that recovery documents (and therefore critical habitat) may be amended from time to time. Species are added as the data becomes ready, which may occur after the recovery document has been posted on the SAR Public Registry. You should always consider the SAR Public Registry as the main source for critical habitat information. In cases where the data is sensitive (e.g. species noted in the List of Species and Ecosystems Susceptible to Persecution or Harm that are managed by the Province of British Columbia), the geographic area within which critical habitat occurs may be represented as “grid squares”. These are coarse (1, 10, 50 or 100 km2) squares based on a UTM grid that serve as a flag to review the associated species’ recovery document. To reiterate, not all of the area within these boundaries is necessarily critical habitat. Critical habitat is defined in the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) as “the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species’ critical habitat in the recovery strategy or action plan for the species”.

DanPo DFO gisp Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas,cgp_aafc,"Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) are areas within Canada's oceans that have been identified through formal scientific assessments as having special biological or ecological significance when compared with the surrounding marine ecosystem. Failure to define an area as an EBSA does not mean that it is unimportant ecologically. All areas serve ecological functions to some extent and require sustainable management. Rather, areas identified as EBSAs should be viewed as the most important areas where, with existing knowledge, regulators and marine users should be particularly risk averse to ensure ecosystems remain healthy and productive. Why are EBSAs identified? EBSA information is used to inform marine planning, including environmental assessment and the siting of marine-based activities, by: - Informing and guiding project-specific or regional environmental assessments; - Informing and guiding industries and regulators in their planning and operations, for example: EBSAs have been acknowledged and referred to (often as ""Special Areas"" or ""Potentially Sensitive Areas"") in oil and gas related assessments; - EBSA information has been provided to proponents of submarine cable projects to be used for route planning purposes; - Informing and guiding Integrated Oceans Management (IOM) process within five Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) and twelve marine bioregions; - Serving as a basis for the identification of Areas of Interest (AOIs) and of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) (individually and in the context of planning bioregional networks of MPAs). How are EBSAs identified? The process used to identify EBSAs is generally comprised of two phases. The first phase involves compiling scientific data and knowledge of a marine area's ecosystems - notably fish species, marine mammals, sea birds, marine flora, marine productivity, physical and chemical conditions and geology. ""Knowledge"" includes experiential knowledge of long-time uses of the areas. In some cases (e.g., in the Arctic), substantial efforts are taken to collect traditional knowledge on ecosystems and environmental conditions from community members, fish harvests, hunters and individuals whose knowledge of the study area complement often helps fill scientific data gaps. In the second phase, the available information for a marine area (e.g. a bioregion) is assessed against five nationally-established science-based criteria including: - Uniqueness: How distinct is the ecosystem of an area compared to surrounding ones? - Aggregation: Whether or not species populate or convene to the study area? - Fitness consequence: How critical the area is to the life history of the species that use it (e.g. is it a spawning or feeding ground)? - Naturalness: How pristine or disturbed by human activities is the study area? - Resilience: What is the ability of the ecosystem to bounce back if it is disturbed? Progress to date and next steps EBSAs have been identified for large portions of Canada's Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as most of the Arctic oceans.

Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT) - Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie Delta,cgp_aafc,"The Beaufort Sea and Mackenzie Delta dataset comes from the Petroleum and Environmental Management Tool (PEMT). The online tool was decommissioned in 2019 and the data was transferred to Open Data in order to preserve it. The PEMT was originally developed in 2009 to help guide development in the Canadian Arctic by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC). The online tool mapped the sensitivities of a variety of Arctic features, ranging from whales to traditional harvesting, across the Arctic. The tool was intended to aid government, oil and gas companies, Aboriginal groups, resource managers and public stakeholders in better understanding the geographic distribution of areas which are sensitive for environmental and socio-economic reasons. The study area and analytical resolution was defined using the oil and gas leasing grid within the Beaufort Sea. The study area has been the scene of oil and gas exploration activity since 1957. Oil was first discovered at Atkinson Point in 1969 and major gas fields in the early 1970s. Such finds spurred the proposal of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline in 1974 and the addition of exploration and investment offshore. Exploration and drilling continued both onshore and offshore until the mid-1970s with the release of the Berger Report, which recommended a 10-year moratorium on the construction of the pipeline. After the release of the Berger Report, the pace of onshore activity declined but offshore exploration escalated in the 1980s. Offshore exploration was facilitated with innovative operating techniques and new offshore platforms that extended the ability to operate in the short open-water season and ice. With the minor exception of the small onshore gas field at Ikhil, no oil or gas has been commercially produced in the area.

The process includes completing detailed ecological and socioeconomic assessments, setting conservation objectives, determining boundaries and management measures, and eventually developing the regulations under section 35 of the Oceans Act. Stakeholders are involved in each step of this process. There is considerable scientific evidence that marine protected areas provide a number of ecological benefits, including the enhanced recruitment of fish species, including those of commercial value, through the protection of spawning areas, larval sources, habitats and migration routes. A well-designed MPA network can scale these benefits up to the regional level, and provide benefits that individual marine protected areas cannot provide on their own. For example, strategically placing marine protected areas in a network can protect key stops along a species' migration route, and protect geographically distinct habitats that serve important life history functions. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization has recognized the use of marine protected areas as complementary to conventional fisheries management measures in helping to achieve sustainable fisheries management objectives.",Feature Layer,"March 12, 2020",7,"['Arctic Ocean', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Pacific Ocean', 'Marine Protected Area', 'Area of Interest', 'Race Rocks', 'St. Lawrence Estuary', 'Shediac Valley', 'AOI', 'Eastern Shore Islands', 'Offshore Pacific', 'Fundian Channel-Browns Bank', 'Southampton Island', 'Marine conservation areas', 'Aquatic ecosystems', 'Marine heritage', 'DFO', 'Canada', 'Government of Canada', 'lang-en', '32bf34ea-d51f-46c9-9945-563989dfcc7b']",https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/775355a1fd5546ba9c713852eef323d9_0,2020-03-12

Atlantic Colonies - Density Analysis,cgp_aafc,"Data Sources: Banque informatisée des oiseaux de mer au Québec (BIOMQ: ECCC-CWS Quebec Region) Atlantic Colonial Waterbird Database (ACWD: ECCC-CWS Atlantic Region).. Both the BIOMQ and ACWD contain records of individual colony counts, by species, for known colonies located in Eastern Canada. Although some colonies are censused annually, most are visited much less frequently. Methods used to derive colony population estimates vary markedly among colonies and among species. For example, census methods devised for burrow-nesting alcids typically rely on ground survey techniques. As such, they tend to be restricted to relatively few colonies. In contrast, censuses of large gull or tern colonies, which are geographically widespread, more appropriately rely on a combination of broad-scale aerial surveys, and ground surveys at a subset of these colonies. In some instances, ground surveys of certain species are not available throughout the study area. In such cases, consideration of other sources, including aerial surveys, may be appropriate. For example,data stemming from a 2006 aerial survey of Common Eiders during nesting, conducted by ECCC-CWS in Labrador, though not yet incorporated in the ACWD, were used in this report. It is important to note that colony data for some species, such as herons, are not well represented in these ECCC-CWS databases at present. Analysis of ACWD and BIOMQ data (ECCC-CWS Quebec and Atlantic Regions): Data were merged as temporal coverage, survey methods and geospatial information were comparable. Only in cases where total counts of individuals were not explicitly presented was it necessary to calculate proxies of total counts of breeding individuals (e.g., by doubling numbers of breeding pairs or of active nests). Though these approaches may underestimate the true number of total individuals associated with a given site by failing to include some proportion of the non-breeding population (i.e., visiting adult non-breeders, sub-adults and failed breeders), tracking numbers of breeding individuals (or pairs) is considered to be the primary focus of these colony monitoring programs.In order to represent the potential number of individuals of a given species that realistically could be and may historically have been present at a given colony location (see section 1.1), the maximum total count obtained per species per site since 1960 was used in the analyses. In the case of certain species,especially coastal piscivores (Wires et al. 2001; Cotter et al. 2012), maxima reached in the 1970s or 1980s likely resulted from considerable anthropogenic sources of food, and these levels may never be seen again. The effect may have been more pronounced in certain geographic areas. Certain sites once used as colonies may no longer be suitable for breeding due to natural and/or human causes, but others similarly may become suitable and thus merit consideration in long-term habitat conservation planning. A colony importance index (CII) was derived by dividing the latter maximum total count by the potential total Eastern Canadian breeding population of that species (the sum of maximum total counts within a species, across all known colony sites in Eastern Canada). The CII approximates the proportion of the total potential Eastern Canadian breeding population (sum of maxima) reached at each colony location and allowed for an objective comparison among colonies both within and across species. In some less-frequently visited colonies, birds (cormorants, gulls, murres and terns, in particular) were not identified to species. Due to potential biases and issues pertaining to inclusion of these data, they were not considered when calculating species' maximum counts by colony for the CII. The IBA approach whereby maximum colony counts are divided by the size of the corresponding actual estimated population for each species (see Table 3.1.2; approximate 1% continental threshold presented) was not used because in some instances individuals were not identified to species at some sites, or population estimates were unavailable.Use of both maxima and proportions of populations (or an index thereof) presents contrasting, but complementary, approaches to identifying important colonial congregations. By examining results derived from both approaches, attention can be directed at areas that not only host large numbers of individuals, but also important proportions of populations. This dual approach avoids attributing disproportionate attention to species that by their very nature occur in very large colonies (e.g., Leach's Storm Petrel) or conversely to colonies that host important large proportions of less-abundant species (Roseate Tern, Caspian Tern, Black-Headed Gull, etc.), but in smaller overall numbers. Point Density Analysis (ArcGIS Spatial Analyst) with kernel estimation, and a 10-km search radius,was used to generate maps illustrating the density of colony measures (i.e., maximum count by species,CII by species), modelled as a continuous field (Gatrell et al. 1996). Actual colony locations were subsequently overlaid on the resulting cluster map.

DanPo Beluga whale critical habitat in the Saguenay River and the St. Lawrence Estuary,cgp_aafc,"The Beluga whale critical habitat, which includes the Upper Estuary, the Saguenay River up to Sainte-Marguerite Bay, and the southern channel of the Lower Estuary, supports the vital functions of calving and rearing of the young. Due to the lack of information, studies are planned in the near future to increase knowledge of the species. Critical habitat actual limitations could change someday. Purpose The beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) population in the St. Lawrence Estuary was greatly reduced by hunting, which was finally banned in the St. Lawrence in 1979. In May 2005, this beluga population was officially listed as a threatened species on SARA’s List of Wildlife Species at Risk. Additional Information St. Lawrence beluga critical habitat is identified using the best available information. All the available information on its prey, seasonal distribution, use and characteristics of its habitat has been reviewed by Mosnier (2010). This literature review was used to produce a science advisory report reviewed by marine mammal experts. Beluga whale critical habitat has been identified with the information and the scientific advice, using the area of occupancy approach and corresponds to the summer distribution of groups made up of adults and new-born calves and juveniles.

Maine Wildlife Management Districts Layer,Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife | Jason.Czapiga@maine.gov_maine,"Wildlife Management Districts are delineated, geographical sections of the State that have similarities in biological and geophysical characteristics. Factors such as geographical location (western mountains vs. downeast coastal plain), soils, predominant forest types (northern hardwoods vs. spruce-fir), seasonal temperature variations, precipitation including annual snowfall, land use (northern forest vs. agricultural), and human population and development, etc., are variables that ultimately influence habitat and the abundance and diversity of wildlife. For each WMD, we made a concerted effort to select clearly recognizable physical boundaries to reduce confusion for hunters. Identification of Wildlife Management Districts benefits MDIFW and hunters in several ways. It helps biologists collect and evaluate data and fine-tune management recommendations. Hunters need refer to only one common set of boundaries for all species they pursue. We use all WMDs individually for managing deer. For other game, WMDs are combined, as needed, to form meaningful hunting zones.In 2000, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) undertook an effort to reduce the confusion of having different hunting zones for deer, moose, turkey, and waterfowl by designing a zoning system that met the management requirements for all species, while unifying boundary lines. As a result of that effort, Maine was divided into 30 parcels, and the term Wildlife Management Districts (WMDs) was born. Some of the boundaries of the Wildlife Management Districts were changed in 2006. There are now only 29 districts.In 2014, MDIFW again updated the WMD boundary written descriptions to reflect changes in road names and to correct other errors.

Manatee Synoptic Survey Flight Routes,Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission | GISLibrarian,"The word synoptic means presenting a general view of the whole. The current manatee synoptic survey is a count of manatees over a broad area. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) uses these surveys to obtain a general count of manatees statewide. The FWC coordinates an interagency team that conducts the synoptic surveys from one to three times each year (weather permitting). The synoptic surveys are conducted in winter and cover all of the known wintering habitats of manatees in Florida. The survey is conducted to meet Florida state statute 370.12 (4), which requires an annual, impartial, scientific benchmark census of the manatee population. From 1991 through 2019, the counts have been conducted 33 times. These statewide, interagency surveys are currently conducted during the coldest weather of the year (January through March) when manatees move to warm-water sites, such as natural springs, thermal discharges from power and industrial plants, and deep canals. The ideal conditions for the current synoptic survey are cool weather, following a prolonged period of cold weather (usually following multiple cold fronts), low winds, and bright sunshine. Weather conditions and manatee behavior during the survey have a large effect on the synoptic counts. For that reason, the counts are used as indicators of relative abundance within a year and are not suitable for assessing long-term population trends. Counts can vary depending on whether it is warm or cold, sunny or cloudy, calm or windy. Manatees are more easily counted a few days after a cold front when it is slightly warmer, clear, and windless.

Landowners, project planners, municipalities or state agencies considering a project in or near an Essential Habitat should immediately contact an MDIFW Regional Wildlife Biologist for assistance.   Essential Wildlife Habitat pertains only to definitions under Maine's endangered species laws (12 MRSA, Chapter 713, Subchapter V, Sections 7754 and 7755-A) and regulations (MDIFW Rules, Chapter 8.05).  Information about and mapped locations of other endangered and threatened species habitats, ""Significant Wildlife Habitat"" (38 MRSA, Chapter 3, Subchapter 1, Section 480-B).   Piping plover (PIPL) and least tern (LETE) essential habitat (EH) focuses on coastal wetlands and sand dune systems to maintain nesting, feeding, and brood-rearing habitats essential to conserving these species and to minimize human-related disturbance that can cause nest failure. ""Nesting"" means the presence of at least one PIPL/LETE nest, egg, or chick. A ""Nesting, feeding and brood-rearing area"" is a locality encompassing portions of coastal wetlands and coastal sand dune systems (including subtidal, intertidal, beach, and associated salt marshes and wetlands) and is used by at least one pair of nesting PIPL/LETE.

Under this Act, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) is designated as the authority for determining Significant Wildlife Habitats (SWHs). The polygons mapped in this GIS data set delineate the location of each DWA as accurately as possible given available information at the time they were created; however, consultation with an MDIFW Regional Biologist is strongly advised for a final determination of the boundaries and current habitat quality of any specific area. For any Significant Wildlife Habitat, a field determination by the MDIFW Regional Biologist takes precedence over the mapped polygon.   A deer wintering area (DWA) is defined as a forested area used by deer when snow depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds 12 inches, deer sinking depth in the open/hardwoods exceeds 8 inches and mean daily temperatures are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Non-forested wetlands, non-stocked clear-cuts, hardwood types, and stands predominated by eastern larch are included within the DWA only if less than 10 acres in size. Agricultural and development areas within DWAs are excluded regardless of size. Evaluation (rating procedure): Deer wintering areas are evaluated based on three criteria: 1) quality of softwood shelter, 2) intensity of deer use, and 3) size. Information on the quality of softwood shelter and intensity of deer use are based on ground survey plots within the final boundary of the DWA being evaluated. The acreage of the DWA is determined after the final outline of the DWA has been drawn. The final rating of the DWA is determined by summing the scores for the three criteria and assigning a rating as follows: high (score of 10-12), moderate (score of 7-9.9) or low (score of 0-6.9). A regional biologist may recommend a rating change with justification and approval by the management section supervisor. No delisting criteria for regulated Natural Resource Protection Act (NRPA) DWAs have been developed. Currently all DWAs are rated as indeterminate.
